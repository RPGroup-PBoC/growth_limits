\section{Energy Production}

While the transport of nutrients is required to build new cell mass, the
metabolic pathways both consume and generate energy
in the form of NTPs. The high-energy phosophodiester bonds of (primarily) ATP
power a variety of cellular processes that drive biological systems away
from thermodynamic equilibrium. The next set of processes we hypothesize might
control the rate of cell division considers the energy budget
of a dividing cell in terms of the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic
phosphate as well as maintenance of the electrochemical proton gradient which powers it.

\subsection{ATP Synthesis}

Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphodiester bond of ATP forming ADP and an
inorganic phosphate is a kinetic driving force in a wide array of biochemical
reactions. One such reaction is the formation of peptide bonds during
translation which requires $\approx$ 2 ATPs for the charging of an amino acid
to the tRNA and $\approx$ 2 ATP equivalents for the formation of the peptide
bond between amino acids. Considering the ATP costs associated with error
correction and post-translational modifications of proteins, we can make the
approximation that each peptide bond has a net cost of $\approx$ 5 ATP (BNID:
107782, \cite{milo2010}). In total, the energetic costs of peptide bond
formation consume $\approx$
80\% of the cells ATP budget (BNID: 107782; 106158; 101637; 111918,
\cite{milo2010, lynch2015,stouthamer1973}). The pool of ATP is produced by
the F$_1$-F$_0$ ATP synthase
-- a membrane-bound rotary motor which under ideal conditions can yield
$\approx$ 300 ATP per second (BNID: 114701; \cite{milo2010, weber2003}).

To estimate the total number of ATP equivalents consumed during a cell cycle,
we will make the approximation that there are $\approx 3\times10^6$ proteins
per cell with an average protein length of $\approx$ 300 peptide bonds (BNID:
115702; 108986; 104877, \cite{milo2010}). Taking these values together, we
estimate that the typical \textit{E. coli} cell consumes $\approx 5 \times
10^9$ ATP per cell cycle on protein synthesis alone and $\approx 6\times
10^9$ ATP in total. Assuming that the ATP synthases are operating at their
fastest possible rate, $\approx$ 3000 ATP synthases are needed to keep up
with the energy demands of the cell. This estimate and a comparison with the
data are shown in \FIG{energy_production} (A). Despite our assumption of
maximal ATP production rate per synthase and approximation of all NTP
consuming reactions being the same as ATP, we find that an estimate of a few
thousand complete synthases per cell to agree well with the experimental
data. Much as we did for the estimates of transporter copy number in the
previous section, we can
generalize this estimation to consider a continuum of growth rates rather than a
point estimate of 5000 s, indicated by the gray lines in
\FIG{energy_production}, and find that this approach adequately describes the
observed growth rate dependence. 

If the direct production of ATP was a rate limiting step for
growth, could the cell simply express more ATP synthase complexes? This
requires us to consider several features of cellular physiology, namely the
physical space on the inner membrane as well as the ability to maintain the
proton chemical gradient leveraged by the synthase to drive ATP production
out of equilibrium.

\subsection{Generating the Proton Electrochemical Gradient}
In order to produce ATP, the F$_1$-F$_0$ ATP synthase itself must consume
energy. Rather than burning through its own product, this intricate
macromolecular machine has evolved to exploit the electrochemical potential
established across the inner membrane through cellular respiration. This
electrochemical gradient is manifest  by the pumping of protons into the
intermembrane space via the electron transport chains as they reduce NADH. In
\textit{E. coli}, this potential difference is $\approx -$200 mV (BNID: 102120,
\cite{milo2010}). A simple estimate of the inner membrane as a capacitor with a
working voltage of -200 mV (as performed in the Supplemental Information)
reveals that $\approx 2\times 10^4$ protons must be present in the intermembrane space.

However, the constant rotation of the ATP synthases would rapidly abolish
this potential difference if it were not being actively maintained. To
undergo a complete rotation (and produce a single ATP), the F$_1$-F$_0$ ATP
synthase must shuttle $\approx$ 4 protons across the membrane into the
cytosol (BNID: 103390, \cite{milo2010}). With $\approx$ 3000 ATP synthases each
generating 300 ATP per second, the $2 \times 10^4$ protons establishing the 200
mV potential would be consumed in only a few milliseconds. This brings us
to our next estimate: how many electron transport complexes are needed to
support the consumption rate of the ATP synthases?

The electrochemistry of the electron transport complexes of \textit{E. coli}
have been the subject of intense biochemical and biophysical study over the past
half century \citep{ingledew1984, khademian2017,cox1970,henkel2014}. A recent
work \citep{szenk2017} examined the respiratory capacity of the \textit{E. coli}
electron transport complexes using structural and biochemical data, revealing
that each electron transport chain rapidly pumps protons into the intermembrane
space at a clip of $\approx$ 1500 protons per second (BIND: 114704; 114687,
\cite{milo2010}). Using our estimate of the number of ATP synthases required per
cell (\FIG{energy_production}(A)), coupled with these recent measurements, we
estimate that $\approx 1000$ electron transport complexes would be necessary to
facilitate the $\approx 4\times 10^6$ protons per second diet of the cellular
ATP synthases. This estimate (along with a generalization to the entire range of
observed growth rates) is in agreement with the number of complexes
identified in the proteomic datasets (plot in \FIG{energy_production}(B)). This
suggests that every ATP synthase must be accompanied by $\approx$ 1 functional
electron transport chain. Again, if this were a rate limiting process for
bacterial growth, one must conclude that it is not possible for the cell to
simply increase the production of both the number of electron transport chain
complexes as well as ATP synthases. As both of these components only function
bound to the inner membrane, we now turn our attention towards the available
space in the membrane as well as surface-area-to-volume constraints.

\subsection{Energy Production in a Crowded Membrane.}

For each protein considered so far, the data shows that in general their numbers
increase with growth rate. This is in part a consequence of the increase in cell
length and width at that is common to many rod-shaped bacteria at faster growth
rates \citep{ojkic2019, harris2018}. For the particular case of \textit{E.
coli}, the total cellular protein and cell size increase logarithmically with
growth rate \citep{schaechter1958, si2017}. Indeed, this is one reason why we
have considered only a single, common growth condition across all our estimates
so far. Such a scaling will require that the total number of proteins and net
demand on resources also grow in proportion to the increase in cell size divided
by the cell's doubling time. Recall however that each transport process, as well
as the ATP production via respiration, is performed at the bacterial membrane.
This means that their maximum productivity can only increase in proportion to
the cell's surface area divided by the cell doubling time. This difference in
scaling would vary in proportion to the surface area-to-volume (S/V) ratio.

While we found that there was more than sufficient membrane real estate for
carbon intake in our earlier estimate, the total number of ATP synthases and
electron chain transport complexes both exhibit a clear increase in copy number
with growth rate, reaching in excess of 10$^4$ copies per cell
(\FIG{energy_production}). Here we consider the consequences of this
S/V ratio scaling in more detail.

In our estimate of ATP production above we found that a cell demands about
$6 \times 10^9$ ATP or $10^6$ ATP/s. With a cell volume of roughly 1 fl, this
corresponds to about $2 \times 10^{10}$ ATP per fL of cell volume, in line  with
previous estimates \citep{stouthamer1977, szenk2017}. In \FIG{energy_scaling} (A)
we plot this ATP demand as a function of the S/V ratio in green, where we have
considered a range of cell shapes from spherical to rod-shaped with an aspect
ratio (length/width) equal to 4 (See appendix for calculations of cell volume
and surface area).  In order to consider the maximum power that could be
produced, we consider the amount of ATP that can generated by a membrane filled
with ATP synthase and electron transport complexes, which provides a maximal
production of about 3 ATP / (nm$^2 \cdot$s) \citep{szenk2017}. This is shown in
blue in \FIG{energy_scaling}(A), which shows that at least for the growth rates
observed, the energy demand is roughly an order of magnitude less.  

Interestingly, \cite{szenk2017} also found that ATP production by
respiration is less efficient than by fermentation per membrane area occupied
due to the additional proteins of the electron transport chain. This suggests
that even under anaerobic growth, there will be sufficient membrane space for
ATP production in general.

While this serves to highlight the diminishing capacity to provide resources to
grow if the cell increases in size (and its S/V decreases), the blue region in
\FIG{energy_scaling}(A) represents a somewhat unachievable limit since the inner
membrane must also include other proteins such as those required for lipid and
membrane synthesis. To gain insight, we used the proteomic data
to look at the distribution of proteins on the inner membrane. Here we use Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations \citep{ashburner2000,thegeneOntologyconsortium2018} to
identify all proteins embedded or peripheral to the inner membrane (GO term:
0005886). Those associated but not membrane-bound include proteins like MreB and
FtsZ, that traverse the inner membrane by treadmilling and must nonetheless be
considered as a vital component occupying space on the membrane. In
\FIG{energy_scaling} (B), we find that the total protein mass per $\mu$m$^2$ is
relatively constant with growth rate. Interestingly, when we consider the
distribution of proteins grouped by their Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG)
\citep{tatusov2000}, the relative abundance for those in metabolism
(including ATP synthesis via respiration) is also relatively constant.
