\section{Introduction}
The observed range of bacterial growth rates is enormously diverse. In natural
environments, some microbial organisms may double only once per year
\citep{mikucki2009} while in comfortable laboratory conditions, growth can be
rapid with several divisions per hour \citep{schaechter1958}. This six
order-of-magnitude difference in time scales of growth encompasses different
microbial species and lifestyles, yet even for a single species such as
\textit{Escherichia coli}, the growth rate can be modulated over a comparably
large scale by tuning the type and amount of nutrients in the growth medium
\citep{liu2005a}. This remarkable plasticity in growth rate illustrates the
intimate relationship between environmental conditions and the rates at which
cells convert nutrients into new cellular material -- a relationship that has
remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a century
\citep{jun2018}.

% Jacques Monod once remarked that ``the study of the growth of bacterial
% cultures does not constitute a specialized subject or branch of research, it
% is the basic method of Microbiology.’’ Those words ring as true today as they
% did when they were written 70 years ago \citep{monod1949} with the
% quantitative power of this "method" recently undergoing renaissance. Many of
% the key questions addressed by the pioneering efforts in the middle of the
% last century can be revisited by examining them through the lens of the
% increasingly refined molecular census that is available for bacteria such as
% the microbial workhorse \textit{E. coli}.

A key discovery in bacterial physiology of the past 70 years was the
identification of bacterial "growth laws" \citep{schaechter1958}; empirical
relationships that relate the bacterial growth rate to the protein and RNA
composition of the intracellular milieu in a number of different species.
Over the past decade, a flurry of work \citep{molenaar2009, scott2010,
klumpp2014, basan2015, dai2016, erickson2017} have examined these growth laws
at a quantitative level, developing a series of phenomenological models from
which the growth laws naturally emerge. In parallel, a "molecular revolution"
in biology has yielded an increasingly refined molecular census of the cell,
particularly for bacteria such as the microbial workhorse \textit{E. coli}
\citep{schmidt2016, davidi2016a}. In light of the now expansive trove of
quantitative biological data, we can revisit several of the evergreen
questions about bacterial growth and physiology that were originally raised
by microbiologists in the middle of the 20th century. Specifically, what
biological processes are the primary determinants for how quickly bacterial
cells can grow and reproduce? Why do cells modulate the absolute numbers and
relative ratios of their molecular constituents as a function of changes in
growth rate or nutrient availability?

In this work, we begin by considering these two questions from two distinct
angles. First, as a result of an array of high-quality proteome-wide
measurements of \textit{E. coli} under diverse growth conditions, we have
generated a census that allows us to explore how the number of key molecular
players change as a function of growth rate. Here, we have assembled a singular
data set of protein copy numbers using measurements collected over the past
decade via mass spectrometry \citep{schmidt2016, peebo2015, valgepea2013} or
ribosomal profiling \citep{li2014} of the composition of the \textit{E. coli}
proteome across a gamut of growth rates. Due to notable changes in cell size and
cellular composition as a function of growth rate \citep{bremer2008,
taheriaraghi2015}, as well as differences in normalization and standardization
schemes used in each experimental work, substantial care was taken to ensure
consistency on a per cellular basis (see the Appendix for a detailed analysis
and additional discussion). To our knowledge, this compiled and curated dataset
represents the most comprehensive view of the \textit{E. coli} proteome,
covering $\approx$ 4000 proteins and 36 unique growth rates, with the observed
abundance of any given protein being directly comparable between data sets and
across growth rates. This allows us to interrogate  the \textit{E. coli}
specific physiology underlying the observed abundances while  minimizing the
effects of experimental noise, as  $\approx$ 75\% of the  proteins are observed
in at least two separate datasets.

Second, by compiling molecular turnover rate measurements for many of the
fundamental processes associated with bacterial growth, we make quantitative
estimates of a handful of key cellular processes (schematized in
\FIG{categories}) to determine whether our current understanding of the
dynamics of these processes are sufficient to explain the magnitude of the
observed protein copy numbers across conditions (see \BOX{estimate_rules}
describing the philosophy behind this approach). The census, combined with
these estimates, provide a window into the question of whether the rates of
central processes such as energy generation or DNA synthesis vary
systematically as a function of cell growth rate by altering protein copy
number.

Throughout our estimates, we consider an archetypal growth rate of $\approx$
0.5 hr$^{-1}$ corresponding to a doubling time of $\approx$ 5000 seconds, as
the data sets examined here heavily sample this growth regime. While we
formulate point estimates for the protein abundances at this division time,
we also consider how these values will vary at other growth rates due to
changes in cell size, surface area, and chromosome copy number
\citep{taheriaraghi2015, harris2018}. For the majority of the processes
considered, we find that the protein copy numbers appear tuned for the task
of cell doubling across a continuum of growth rates. Thus, our understanding
of the kinetics of various biological processes is sufficient to
quantitatively explain the observed abundances of these proteins.

% From these estimates, it emerges that translation, particularly the synthesis of
% ribosomal proteins, is a plausible candidate that limits the rate of cellular
% growth in \textit{E. coli}.

From these estimates, it emerges that translation,  particularly the synthesis of ribosomal proteins is a
plausible candidate that limits the rate of cellular growth in \textit{E. coli}.
We reach this conclusion by considering that ribosome synthesis is 1) a rate
limiting step for the \textit{fastest} bacterial division, and  2) the main
determinant of bacterial growth rate across  nutrient conditions associated with
moderate to fast growth rates. In addition, a strict dependence between the
maximal growth rate and ribosomal mass fraction coincides with the regime where
the growth laws appear most valid \citep{amir2017, scott2010}. This enables us
to suggest that the long-observed correlation between growth rate and cell size
\citep{schaechter1958, si2017} can be simply attributed to the increased
absolute number of ribosomes per cell under conditions supporting extremely
rapid growth. To better understand how the observed alterations in absolute
protein abundances, and in particular, changes in ribosome copy number,
influence growth rate across different nutrient conditions we consider a minimal
model of cellular growth. Our conclusions from these analyses provide important
insight into how \textit{E. coli} regulates growth across conditions of
differing nutrient availability and identifies fundamental constraints in
bacterial growth more broadly.
