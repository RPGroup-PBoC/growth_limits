\section{Summary of Proteome Datasets.}

Here we briefly summarize the datasets that were considered for the work of the main
text. The goal of this section is to give an overview of each dataset
considered, including the main experimental details, and to provide a more
detailed look at how well each compares.

Table \ref{table:datasets} provides an overview of the proteomic datasets that
we found in the literature. These are predominately mass spectrometry-based,
with the exception of the work from Li {\it et al.} (2014) which used ribosomal
profiling, and the fluorescence-based counting done in Taniguchi {\it et al.}
(2010). The general strategy taken in these works is to quantify fractional
abundance of each protein and then to convert these to absolute abundance by
multiplying these fractions by the bulk measured total cellular protein
abundance. Note that the work of Peebo {\it et al.} (2014) did not perform any
measurement of cell count or volume, and thus were only able to report cellular
protein concentration.

Exceptions to this are found in Schmidt {\it et al.} and Taniguchi {\it et al.}.
A key distinction in the work of Schmidt {\it et al.} is that in addition to
determining relative abundance by mass spectrometry, they also selected 41
enzyme that cover over four orders of magnitude in cellular abundance to use in
absolute protein quantification. Specifically, synthetic peptides were generated
for each of these 41 enzymes and used to provide a calibration between measured
mass spectrometry intensities and absolute protein abundances (using stable
isotope dilution (SID) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), though the
details of this are beyond the scope of this section). In the work of Taniguchi
{\it et al.},  the authored tagged each protein with a  yellow fluorescent
protein (YFP) and used fluorescence as readout of cellular expression.

Figure \ref{} shows the distribution in reported protein abundance for   a  subset
of  the data.

An important consideration is whether the reported abundance per cell are correlated. while
we expect some variability in expression of each protein due to growth rate, the reported
values are nonetheless expected to be correlated. Figure \ref{fig:dataset_correlations} compares each dataset to the copy numbers from Schmidt {\it et al.}, grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.

% NB: It may be helpful to appeal to the 'classic growth laws' early on in this text
% as a rational to guide thinking with expectations about total cell mass, cell volume w.r.t.
% growth rate.

The datasets encompass a range of bacterial growth conditions,  different {\it
e. coli} strains, and for those that report quantities on a cell basis,
different methods to normalize  by  cell count and volume. It was therefore
important to consider if certain discrepancies exist across the data and whether
these might be reasonably dealt with to make the compilated dataset internally
consistent. - give reference to what was done in example of yeast proteome data
corrections. However, given the work of [cite] and others, there are
well-documented expectations about how characteristics such as total protein
mass per cell and cell volume  should scale with growth rate. We were therefore
inclined to only renormalize data in a  way  that took into account such
expectations. Figure \ref{} shows the total protein  mass reported as a function
of growth rate for each experiment. Indeed, with the exception of the work of
Peebo et al., the total mass per cell is generally consistent as a function of
growth rate, and provide some confidence in such an approach.

In the remainder of this section we describe the rescaling that was done to each
dataset, with a particular focus on correcting for discrepencies in cellular
protein concentration, which may reflect differences in protein extraction
efficiency. It is important to note that with the exception of the work from
Peebo {\it et al.} (which is discussed more below), any rescaling is only
performed within the data of individual authors and not performed globally. We
felt this was important in order not to bias any individuals' work since we lack
any true standard of protein abundance.

% a descrpency in expected versus reported cell volume that required additional
% care and is further described below. Lastly, the  data from Peebo {\it et al.}
% required additional care due to a lack quantities on a cell basis, and we
% consider this work separately.


\subsection{Corrections to Enforce a Consistent Cellular Protein Concentration}

% NB: It may be useful to note that none of this should have any effect on the relative
% abundances found in each dataset.

One parameter that we do not expect to change substantially across growth
conditions is cellular protein concentration. As a general rule of thumb, we
expect an {\it e. coli} cell to have about 30\% dry mass, with about 55\% of
this expected from protein. With a density of about 1.1 g/ml, we find that the
protein concentration in a cell should be approximately 180 fg/fL.  The cellular
density and dry mass are essentially fixed, with the fraction of cellular
protein varying from [X-Y; refs??]. Hence,  this parameter provides a useful
reference point that datasets should agree on.  Indeed, out of concern over
differences in protein extraction efficiency in growth phases like stationary
phase, Schmidt {\it et al.} applied a correction to their measured protein
abundances to ensure cellular protein concentrations were internally consistent.


From the work of Schmidt {\it et al.} they reported an ability to consistently get high
protein yield from cells grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose. In order
to account any protein loss during extraction, they use their measured protein concentration
from this sample as a reference for which total protein concentration in all other growth
conditions should match. This is shown in Figure \ref{}A. One challenge in
performing this calculation is that cell volume must be known; the authors use
volumes that were  measured by flow cytometry in previous work [cite]. These
volumes are shown in Figure \ref{}B. While it is difficult to assess the
accuracy of these numbers, we find them to be quite inconsistent with the
expected scaling that is reported by Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.} (2015),
carefully
measured as a function of growth rate [and other work?].

In addition,  since cell volume was not determined in all studies, and to be
consistent throughout, we instead use the predicted cell volumes from
Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.}. Dealing with each dataset seperately, we apply
correction  factors to correct for discrepencies in protein concentration across
the different growth conditions considered [NB: I wonder if in these other
datasets, the more appropriate thing to do is match to the average measured
protein concentration]. Specifically, the scaling factor $\phi$ is given by,

\begin{equation}
\phi  =  \frac{P_i}{V_i} \cdot [P]_r
\end{equation}

where $P_i$ is the total protein mass in conditino $i$, $V_i$ is the estimated cell volume, and $[P]_r$ is
the reference protein concentration (i.e. growth in  glucose for the Schmidt data).


\subsection{Peebo {\it et al.}: Conversion from copies/ fL to copies per cell}

In the work of Peebo {\it et al.}, the authors only report protein concentration.
In  order to determine protein per cell, we multiple these concentrations by
expected cell volumes  using the predictions from  Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.} This is
shown in Figure \ref{}A, where we see that reported mass is substantially lower than
the other work considered here; as well as work from others [Sinauer, 1990].

Indeed, both Schmidt {\it et al.} and Li {\it et al.} reported a total protein mass of about
250 fg per cell at a growth rate of about $\lambda \approx 0.5 hr^{-1}$ ( M9
minimal media with glucose and MOPS minimal media, respectively). Given this
discrepancy, in addition to requiring that cellular protein concentration be
internally consistent across the growth conditions they reported on, we also
required that total cellular mass be consistent with the work Schmidt {\it et al.} and
Li {\it et al.} This amounted to performing a linear regression between total protein
mass and growth rate, and using this to scale the Peebo {\it et al.} dataset according
to this trend.

\section{Translation-dependent limits on the rate of cell division.}

Here we consider the hypothesis that the process of translation sets the speed
limit of bacterial growth. We begin by considering the synthesis of the ribosome
itself, finding that it sets a strict limit on division time, and then from there we
consider how the abundance of other cellular proteins limits this achievable growth rate further.

\subsection{Maximum possible growth rate is set by the time to make a ribosome.}

\marginnote{\small{NB: I wonder if this should include the time to make other
ribosomal components in addition to core subunits.}}

Ribosomes take a unique position among proteins due to their role in replicating
the entire cellular proteome. In order for a cell to maintain its own pool of
ribosomes during division into two daughter cells, a primary requirement is that
each ribosome must make all the protein subunits for a second ribosome.  Since
the  mass of a single ribosome is about 2.5 MDa, with about 2/3 RNA and 1/3
protein, each ribosome has to make about 800 kDa of protein. In {\it E. coli},
this corresponds to 7,459 amino acids. At a maximal translation rate of 20 amino
acids per second, this would take just over 6 minutes.  Growing any faster would
result in a drop in the average number of ribosomes as the cell divides and
highlights a strict time limit on how fast a cell can double itself.  This result is
irrespective of the absolute number of ribosomes, and contrasts with other
proteins where the simple solution to making more proteins is to apparently
devote more ribosomes to their synthesis.

\subsection{The translation-limited growth rate is set by the fraction of
ribosomal mass.}

While the inability to parallelize ribosomal synthesis sets an inherent speed
limit, this represents a somewhat unachievable growth rate since ribosomes must
also spend some of their time doubling the remaining proteome.
A translation-limited rate of growth is therefore set by the time to
double the entire proteome.

% The only way to reach the minimum duplication time
% set by the ribosome would be to increase the relative fraction of ribosomes.
% This would effectively reduce the time needed to duplicate the non-ribosomal
% proteins.

In order to understand the consequence of each ribosome having to duplicate
itself and devote time to double the remaining proteome, we consider a
hypothetical cell that consists of only two species of protein: ribosomes and
non-ribosomal proteins. The cell is taken to contain $R$ ribosomes per cell, and $P$
non-ribosomal proteins per cell. The time $\tau$ needed to duplicate the entire
proteome is simply given by,

\begin{equation}
	\tau = \tau_R + \tau_P,
\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_R$ is the time to double a ribosome, while $\tau_P$ is the time
required to double the remaining proteins. While we found that $\tau_R$ is fixed
at about 6 minutes,  $\tau_P$  will depend on the number of ribosomes $R$ available and
can be approximated by,

\begin{equation}
\tau_P = \frac{N_{aa}}{r_t \cdot R}.
\label{eq:tau_P}
\end{equation}
Here $N_{aa}$ refers to the total number of amino acids (aa) that must be translated,
while $r_t$ refers to the rate of translation, at about 20 aa /
sec. Finally, we can calculate a translation-limited growth rate from,

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} =  \frac{ln(2)} {\tau}.
\end{equation}
Using Equation \ref{eq:tau_P} and \ref{eq:tau}, this becomes,
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} =  \frac{ln(2)} {\tau_R + \frac{N_{aa}}{r_t \cdot R}}.
\label{eq:lambda_max}
\end{equation}
We can see from Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max} that the only way to increase the
translation-limited growth rate would be to make more ribosomes, or if it were
possible, to decrease the number of non-ribosomal proteins.

Next, let's consider some representative values for $R$ and $N_{aa}$, and
determine $\lambda_{\text{max}}$. From Schmidt {\it et al.}\cite{Schmidt2016},
cells grown in glucose were found to have 214 fg of non-ribosomal  protein mass.
This corresponds to about 1.17 x 10$^9$ amino acids. We also estimate a
ribosomal copy number, $R$ = 20,656 per cell, based on the mean copy number of
individual subunits that were reported. Using Equation
\ref{eq:lambda_max}, this corresponds to a maximum growth rate of 0.78 hr$^{-1}$,
versus the measured rate of 0.58 hr$^{-1}$, suggesting cells are growing somewhat below their maximal rate.

As we noted above, the only way to divide faster than this limit of 0.78 hr$^{-1}$
would be to make more ribosomes. We therefore consider how this maximal growth
rate might vary as a function of ribosomal copy number. One difficultly that
arises is that in order for a cell to add more ribosomes, it will need to
increase in size. This might require that other proteins also increase in number to
maintain a specific proportion relative to the cell size. However, to keep our problem simple, lets proceed
with the simplifying assumption that the value of $N_{aa}$ is sufficient to
build a cell irrespective of the number of ribosomes. This in effect provides us with a
lower bound on the total proteomic content at faster growth rates and a lower
limit on the achievable growth rate. In Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1}
we plot $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ as a function
of ribosome copy number per cell. While indeed, the maximum attainable growth
rate is that set by the time to make a ribosome, we see that it can only be
achieved if the number of ribosomes was increased about 100 fold.

\begin{figure}[H]

	 	showing the translation-limited growth rate as a function of ribosomal mass
	 	fraction.}
  \label{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1}
\end{figure}

To consider what this might mean with respect to cell size, note that cell
volume will be proportional to cell mass. We can estimate a lower bound on the
required cell volume as a function of the number of ribosomes by assuming a mass
density of 1.1 g/ml, and a dry mass of 30\% that consists of only protein and
RNA.  This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_volume}, and shows
that the cell volume would need to be excessively large in order to hold such a
large number of ribosomes, with a volume of about 25 $f$L when $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ is equal
to the time to generate a ribosome.

	a 30 \% dry mass, and cell mass density of 1.1 g/ml. }
  \label{fig:estimates_translation_volume}
\end{figure}

As a last consideration, one additional observation from Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1}B
is an apparently linear dependence
between $\lambda_{\text{max}}$  and the fraction of ribosomal mass. This, along with the
dramatic scaling in ribosomal copy number, are particularly relevant to the
phenomenological growth laws reported by others on how cell size and cell mass
scale with growth rate in bacteria. The linear scaling appears to be a feature
irrespective of the size of the non-ribosomal mass, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_ribo_frac}. Indeed, with a bit of algebra, we can
re-write the translation-limited growth rate defined by Equation
\ref{eq:lambda_max} as a function of ribosomal mass fraction, denoted by
$\Phi_R$, as,

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} =  \frac{ln(2)} {L_R} \cdot r_t \cdot \Phi_R.
\end{equation}
$L_R$ refers to the number of amino acids that make a single
ribosome ($L_R$ = 7,459 aa for {\it E. coli}). As a sanity check, we can quickly
see that if $\Phi_R$ = 1, we are once again limited only by the time required to
double a ribosome and the rate of translation.

	result from Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1}B, we recalculate the maximum growth rate as

\subsection{Growth only appears translation-limited in rich growth media.}

% \marginnote{\small{NB: A better way would be to directly calculate the number of
% aa from proteomic sequences and copy number.}}

% \marginnote{\small{NB: There is something weird about the fraction of ribosomal
% protein in Peebo, Valgepea; it is higher, and also higher than that found in Scott
% {\it et al.}  - is it real??}}

With some expectation on the maximum growth rate achievable as a function of
ribosomal content as discussed above, lets now take a look at our experimental
data. To simplify our calculations, we approximate the number of amino acids
that must be translated from the reported non-ribosomal protein mass by assuming
an average molecular weight for an amino acid of 110 Da ($N_{aa}$ = $($mass$ /
110$ Da$) \cdot N_A$). Using Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max}, we can then calculate
the maximum rate of growth under translation limitation. In Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}A we plot this maximal growth rate,
$\lambda_{\text{max}}$,  against the measured growth rates, while in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}B we plot the cell cycle time that would be
associated with these growth rates. The shaded regions identify the regions that
should not be attainable with a translation rate $t_r$, of 20 aa/sec. From these two
plots, it appears to we are only translation-limited in rich media (data points
with growth rates great than 1 hr$^{-1}$ in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}A)). Though it should be noted that a more
careful calculation of the maximum tranlation time suggested by Equation
\ref{eq:lambda_max} needs to be undertaken.



\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../../code/figures/SI/estimates_translation_data.pdf}
  \caption{{\bf Comparison of translation-limited rate of growth to observed growth rates.}
	A) Plot of maximum growth rates based on reported cell mass and calculated from Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max}.
	B) Related to (A), but instead plotting the cell cycle time in minutes.
	The light shaded regions in (A) and (B) reflect boundaries where growth would not be possible
	due to a translation rate of 20 aa/sec. The dark shaded region in (B) corresponds to the maximum
	division rate set by doubling a ribosome.
	(\smaller{NB: There is something weird about the fraction of ribosomal
	protein in Peebo, Valgepea; it is higher, and also higher than that found in Scott
	{\it et al.}  - is it real??})}
  \label{fig:estimates_translation_data}
\end{figure}


From Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}B, it is apparent that for cells with
slower growth, the cell cycle time is indeed much longer than might have
been expected given a translation rate of 20 aa/sec. We can actually infer what
the effective translation is given the observed growth rates, which we show
in Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_rate}.  Interestingly, these
translation rates are in good agreement with those measured in Dai {\it et al.}
\cite{Dai2016}, which were also shown to decrease when grown under limited nutrient conditions.

% though that work also suggests that the fraction of active
% ribosomes may decrease in poor nutrient conditions, further suggesting that
% under a certain regime cells may not be utilizing their full ribosomal capacity
% (i.e. not translation-limited).

\marginnote{\small{JT suggests using measured elongation rate in Dai {\it et al.} to redefine
translation boundaries in Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}.}}
