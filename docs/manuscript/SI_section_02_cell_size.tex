\section{Estimation of Cell Size and Surface Area}
\label{sec:protein_size_SV}
Since most of the proteomic data sets lack cell size (i.e. volume) measurements, we chose
instead to use a common estimate of size for any analysis requiring cell
size or surface area.  Since each of the data sets used either K-12 MG1655 or
its derivative, BW25113 (from the lab of Barry L. Wanner; the parent strain of
the Keio collection \citep{datsenko2000, baba2006}), we fit the MG1655 cell size
data from the supplemental material of \cite{si2017, si2019} using the optimize.curve\_fit function
from the Scipy python package \citep{2020scipynmeth}.

The average size measurements from each of their experiments are shown in Figure
\FIG{final_size_data_Si}, with  cell length and width shown in (A) and (B),
respectively. The length data was well described by the exponential function 0.5
$e^{1.09 \cdot \lambda}$ + 1.76 \textmu m, while the width data was well
described by 0.64 $e^{0.24 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m. In order to estimate cell
size we take the cell as a cylinders with two hemispherical ends \citep{si2017,
basan2015}. Specifically,  cell size  is estimated from,

\begin{equation}
V = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot (l - 2r/3),
\label{eq:cell_size}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is half the cell width. A best fit to the data is described by 0.533
$e^{1.037 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m$^3$. Calculation of the cell surface area is
given by,

\begin{equation}
 S = \eta \cdot \pi (\frac{\eta \cdot \pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{12})^{-2/3} V^{2/3},
 \label{eq:surface_area}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the aspect ratio ($\eta$ = $l/w$) \citep{ojkic2019}.

    Cell lengths and (B) cell widths show the mean measurements reported (they
    report 140-300 images and 5,000-30,000 for each set of samples; which likely
    means about 1,000-5,000 measurements per mean value reported here since they
    considered about 6 conditions at a time). Fits were made to the  MG1655 strain
    data; length: 0.5 $e^{1.09 \cdot \lambda}$ + 1.76 \textmu m, width:  0.64
    $e^{0.24 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m. (C) Cell size, $V$, was calculated as
    cylinders with two hemispherical ends (Equation \ref{eq:cell_size}). The

\section{Estimation of Total Protein Content per Cell}
\label{sec:estimate_protein_per_cell}
In order to estimate total protein per cell for a particular growth rate, we
begin by estimating the cell size from the fit shown in Figure
\FIG{final_size_data_Si}(C) (0.533 $e^{1.037 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m$^3$). We
then estimate the total protein content from the total dry mass of the cell.
Here we begin by noting that  for almost the entire range of growth rates
considered here, protein, DNA, and RNA were reported to account for at least 90
\% of the dry mass (\cite{basan2015}). The authors also found that the total dry
mass concentration was roughly constant across growth conditions. Under such a
scenario, we can calculate the total dry mass concentration for protein, DNA,
and RNA, which is given by 1.1 g/ml x 30 \% x 90 \% or about $[M_P]$ = 300 fg
per fl. Multiplying this by our prediction of cell size gives the total dry mass
per cell.

However, even if dry mass concentration is relatively constant across growth
conditions, it is not obvious how protein concentration might vary due to
the substantial increase in rRNA at faster
growth rates (\cite{dai2016}). This is a well-documented result that arises from
an increase in ribosomal abundance at faster growth rates
(\cite{scott2010}). To proceed therefore rely on experimental
measurements of total DNA content per cell that also come from Basan \textit{et
al.}, and RNA to protein ratios that were measured in Dai \textit{et al.} (and
cover the entire range of growth conditions considered here). These are
reproduced in Figure \FIG{schmidt_adjustment_varying_conc}(A) and (B),
respectively.

Assuming that the protein, DNA, and RNA account for 90 \% of the total dry mass,
the protein mass can then determined by first subtracting the experimentally
measured DNA mass,  and then using the experimental estimate of the RNA to
protein ratio. The total protein per cell is will be related to the summed RNA
and protein mass by,

\begin{equation}
	M_{P} = \frac{[M_P + M_{RNA}]}{1 + (RP_{ratio})}.
\end{equation}
$(RP_{ratio}$ refers to the RNA to protein ratio as measured by Dai \textit{et
al.}. In Figure \FIG{schmidt_adjustment_varying_conc}(C) we plot the estimated
cellular concentrations for protein, DNA, and RNA from these calculations, and
in Figure \FIG{schmidt_adjustment_varying_conc}(D) we plot their total expected
mass per cell. This later quantity is the growth rate-dependent total protein
mass that was used to estimate total protein abundance across all data sets (and
summarized in \FIG{total_protein_final}(B)).

  \lambda}$ + 7.2 fg per cell, where $\lambda$ is the growth rate in hr$^{-1}$).

  the RNA/protein ratio is given by 0.25$\cdot \lambda$ + 0.035. For (A) and (B)

  conditions, and rich-defined media for fast growth rates. (C) Predictions of

\subsection{Estimating Volume and Number of Amino Acids from Ribosome Copy Number}
Towards the end of the main text, we examine a coarse-grained model of
nutrient-limited growth. A key point in our analysis was to consider  how
elongation rate $r_t$ and growth rate $\lambda$ vary with respect to the
experimentally observed changes in cell size, total number of peptide bonds per
cell  $N_\text{pep}$, and ribosomal content.  In order to do maintain parameters
in line with the experimental data, but otherwise allow us to explore the
model, we performed a phenomenological fit of $N_\text{pep}$ and $V$ as a
function of the measured ribosomal copy number $R$. As has been described in the
preceding sections of this supplement, we estimate cell volume for each growth
condition using the size measurements from \cite{si2017,si2019}, and
$N_\text{pep}$ is approximated by taking the total protein mass and dividing
this number by the average mass of an amino acid, 110 Da (BNID: 104877).

Given the  exponential scaling of $V$ and $N_\text{pep}$ with growth rate,
we performed a linear regression of the log transform of these parameters
as a function of the log transform of the ribosome copy number. Using
optimization by minimization, we estimated the best-fit values of the intercept
and slope for each regression. \FIG{naa_v_fit} shows the result of each
regression as a dashed line, given in terms of the linear-scaled data.

    line shows the result of the fit, with the functional form of the equation
    given in the legend with $R$ representing the ribosome copy number.}
