\section{Methods}

\subsection{Data Analysis and Availability}
All proteomic measurements come from the experimental work of \cite{schmidt2016,
peebo2015, valgepea2013} (mass spectrometry) and \cite{li2014} (ribosomal
profiling). Data curation and analysis was done programmatically in Python, and
compiled data and analysis files are accessible through a
\href{https://github.com/rpgroup-pboc/growth_limits}{GitHub repository}
(DOI:XXX) associated with this paper as well as on the associated
\href{https://rpgroup.caltech.edu/growth_limits}{paper website}. Additionally,
we provide two interactive figures that allow for
\href{https://rpgroup.caltech.edu/growth_limits}{rapid exploration of the
compiled data sets} as well as
\href{https://rpgroup.caltech.edu/growth_limits}{exploration of the parameter
space of the minimal model}.
