  abstract = {Bacterial physiology is a branch of biology that aims to understand overarching principles of cellular reproduction. Many important issues in bacterial physiology are inherently quantitative, and major contributors to the field have often brought together tools and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. This article presents a comprehensive overview of major ideas and approaches developed since the early 20th century for anyone who is interested in the fundamental problems in bacterial physiology. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part (sections 1\textendash{}3), we review the first `golden era' of bacterial physiology from the 1940s to early 1970s and provide a complete list of major references from that period. In the second part (sections 4\textendash{}7), we explain how the pioneering work from the first golden era has influenced various rediscoveries of general quantitative principles and significant further development in modern bacterial physiology. Specifically, section 4 presents the history and current progress of the `adder' principle of cell size homeostasis. Section 5 discusses the implications of coarsegraining the cellular protein composition, and how the coarse-grained proteome `sectors' re-balance under different growth conditions. Section 6 focuses on physiological invariants, and explains how they are the key to understanding the coordination between growth and the cell cycle underlying cell size control in steady-state growth. Section 7 overviews how the temporal organization of all the internal processes enables balanced growth. In the final section 8, we conclude by discussing the remaining challenges for the future in the field.},

The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

These quantities could be described as exponential functions of the growth rates afforded by the various media at a given temperature. The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.},

  abstract = {Metabolic network models describing growth of Escherichia coli on glucose, glycerol and acetate were derived from a genome scale model of E. coli. One of the uncertainties in the metabolic networks is the exact stoichiometry of energy generating and consuming processes. Accurate estimation of biomass and product yields requires correct information on the ATP stoichiometry. The unknown ATP stoichiometry parameters of the constructed E. coli network were estimated from experimental data of eight different aerobic chemostat experiments carried out with E. coli MG1655, grown at different dilution rates (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 h-1) and on different carbon substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetate). Proper estimation of the ATP stoichiometry requires proper information on the biomass composition of the organism as well as accurate assessment of net conversion rates under well-defined conditions. For this purpose a growth rate dependent biomass composition was derived, based on measurements and literature data. After incorporation of the growth rate dependent biomass composition in a metabolic network model, an effective P/O ratio of 1.49 {$\pm$} 0.26 mol of ATP/mol of O, KX (growth dependent maintenance) of 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.27 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass and mATP (growth independent maintenance) of 0.075 {$\pm$} 0.015 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass/h were estimated using a newly developed Comprehensive Data Reconciliation (CDR) method, assuming that the three energetic parameters were independent of the growth rate and the used substrate. The resulting metabolic network model only requires the specific rate of growth, \textmu, as an input in order to accurately predict all other fluxes and yields. Biotechnol.

Of the elements detected, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, potassium, and calcium together made up 15 to 17\% of the dry matter content. A phosphorus content of 4.2 to 5.4\% of the dry matter was found in these cells. Volume measurements of air-dried cells gave an average of 1.20 to 1.25 micron3. These results emphasize that dry matter content and elemental composition can be measured directly on single cells from complex microbial communities.},

Examination of the genome suggests that many more will be found, especially genes involved in regulation, scavenging of sulfur containing molecules and synthesis of coenzymes or prosthetic groups. Furthermore, the involvement of methionine as the universal start of proteins as well as that of its derivative Sadenosylmethionine in a vast variety of cell processes argue in favour of a major importance of sulfur metabolism in all organisms.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a biologically potent molecule, and the regulation of ammonia levels in the mammalian body is, therefore, strictly controlled. The molecular paths of ammonia permeation across plasma membranes remain ill-defined, but the structural similarity of water and NH3 has pointed to the aquaporins as putative NH3-permeable pores. Accordingly, a range of aquaporins from mammals, plants, fungi, and protozoans demonstrates ammonia permeability. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is highly expressed at perivascular glia end-feet in the mammalian brain and may, with this prominent localization at the blood-brain-interface, participate in the exchange of ammonia, which is required to sustain the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Here we observe that AQP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes display a reflection coefficient {$<$}1 for NH4Cl at pH 8.0, at which pH an increased amount of the ammonia occurs in the form of NH3. Taken together with an NH4Cl-mediated intracellular alkalization (or lesser acidification) of AQP4-expressing oocytes, these data suggest that NH3 is able to permeate the pore of AQP4. Exposure to NH4Cl increased the membrane currents to a similar extent in uninjected oocytes and in oocytes expressing AQP4, indicating that the ionic NH4+ did not permeate AQP4. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed partial pore permeation events of NH3 but not of NH4+ and a reduced energy barrier for NH3 permeation through AQP4 compared with that of a cholesterol-containing lipid bilayer, suggesting AQP4 as a favored transmembrane route for NH3. Our data propose that AQP4 belongs to the growing list of NH3-permeable water channels.},

  abstract = {Mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 were constructed such that each possessed one single major system for phosphate transport. A comparison of these strains showed that one of the systems (PIT) was fully constitutive, required no binding protein, and operated in spheroplasts. It permitted the complete exchange of intracellular phosphate with extracellular phosphate (or arsenate) and was completely inhibited by uncouplers. The other system, PST, was repressible by phosphate concentrations above 1 mM, required the phosphate-binding protein for full activity, and did not operate in spheroplasts. It catalyzed very little exchange between internal and external phosphate and was resistant to uncouplers. The maximal velocities attained by the two systems were approximately the same, but the affinity for phosphate in the PST system was greater by two orders of magnitude. In strains in which both systems were fully operative, the initial rates of uptake was nearly additive, and the systems appeared to interact with a common intracellular phosphate pool.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate\textendash{}carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is responsible for the transport and phosphorylation of sugars, such as glucose. PTS activity has a crucial role in the global signaling system that controls the preferential consumption of glucose over other carbon sources. When the cell is exposed to carbohydrate mixtures, the PTS prevents the expression of catabolic genes and activity of non-PTS sugars transport systems by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This process defines some metabolic and physiological constraints that must be considered during the development of production strains. In this review, we summarize the importance of the PTS in controlling and influencing both PTS and non-PTS sugar transport processes as well as the mechanisms of transcriptional control involved in the expression of catabolic genes of non-PTS sugars in E. coli. We discuss three main approaches applied efficiently to avoid these constraints resulting in obtaining PTS- glc+ mutants useful for production purposes: (1) adaptive selection in chemostat culture system of PTS- mutants, resulting in the selection of strains that recovered the ability to grow in glucose, along with the simultaneous consumption of two carbon sources and reduced acetate production; (2) replacement in PTS- strains of the native GalP promoter by strong promoters or the substitution of this permease by recombinant glucose transport system; and (3) enhancement of Crp (crp+) in mgsA, pgi, and ptsG mutants, resulting in derivative strains that abolished CCR, allowing the simultaneous consumption of mixtures of sugars with low acetate production.},

Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavailable carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the environment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving conditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymerase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activation. Significant differences in RNAP distribution in vivo, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent protein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-specific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacterial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior.},

We introduce a new method (Reg-Seq) linking a massively-parallel reporter assay and mass spectrometry to produce a base pair resolution dissection of more than 100 promoters in E. coli in 12 different growth conditions. First, we show that our method recapitulates regulatory information from known sequences. Then, we examine the regulatory architectures for more than 80 promoters in the E. coli genome which previously had no known regulation. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate their regulation. The method introduced here clears a path for fully characterizing the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving on to an array of other microbes of ecological and medical relevance.},

However, while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here, we take a first step toward multipromoter dissection and show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect multiple bacterial promoters in a systematic way. We show this approach on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases, we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input\textendash{}output relationships. Given the generality of the approach presented here, it opens up the possibility of quantitatively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.},

The low-affinity Pi transporter (pitA) is expressed constitutively and is dependent on the proton motive force, while the high-affinity Pst system (pstSCAB) is induced at low external Pi concentrations by the phoregulon and is an ABC transporter. We isolated a third putative Pi transport gene, pitB, from E. coli K-12 and present evidence that pitB encodes a functional Pi transporter that may be repressed at low Pi levels by the pho regulon. While apitB+ cosmid clone allowed growth on medium containing 500 {$\mu$}M Pi, E. coli with wild-type genomic pitB (pitA{$\Delta$}pstC345 double mutant) was unable to grow under these conditions, making it indistinguishable from a pitA pitB{$\Delta$}pstC345 triple mutant. The mutation {$\Delta$}pstC345 constitutively activates thepho regulon, which is normally induced by phosphate starvation. Removal of pho regulation by deleting thephoB-phoR operon allowed thepitB+pitA{$\Delta$}pstC345 strain to utilize Pi, with Pi uptake rates significantly higher than background levels. In addition, the apparent Kmof PitB decreased with increased levels of protein expression, suggesting that there is also regulation of the PitB protein. Strain K-10 contains a nonfunctional pitA gene and lacks Pit activity when the Pst system is mutated. The pitAmutation was identified as a single base change, causing an aspartic acid to replace glycine 220. This mutation greatly decreased the amount of PitA protein present in cell membranes, indicating that the aspartic acid substitution disrupts protein structure.},

Additional sulfur-containing compounds from the cysteine synthesis pathway have also been analyzed for their abilities to interact with CysZ. Our results suggest that CysZ is dedicated to a specific pathway that assimilates sulfate for the synthesis of cysteine. Sulfate uptake via CysZ into E. coli whole cells and proteoliposome offers direct evidence of CysZ being able to mediate sulfate uptake. In addition, the cysteine synthesis pathway intermediate sulfite can interact directly with CysZ with higher affinity than sulfate. The sulfate transport activity is inhibited in the presence of sulfite, suggesting the existence of a feedback inhibition mechanism in which sulfite regulates sulfate uptake by CysZ. Sulfate uptake assays performed at different extracellular pH and in the presence of a proton uncoupler indicate that this uptake is driven by the proton gradient.},

  abstract = {Evidence is presented that lactose uptake into whole cells of Escherichia coli occurs by symport with a single proton over the range of external pH 6.5--7.7. The proton/lactose stoicheiometry has been measured directly over this pH range by comparison of the initial rates of proton and lactose uptake into anaerobic resting cell suspensions of E. coli ML308. Further, the relationship between the protonmotive force and lactose accumulation has been studied in E. coli ML308-225 over the range of external pH 5.9--8.7. At no point was the accumulation of the beta-galactoside in thermodynamic equilibrium with the protonmotive force. It is concluded that the concentration of lactose within the cell is governed by kinetic factors rather than pH-dependent changes in the proton/substrate stoicheiometry. The relevance of these findings to the model of pH-dependent proton/substrate stoicheiometries derived from studies with E. coli membrane vesicles is discussed.},
