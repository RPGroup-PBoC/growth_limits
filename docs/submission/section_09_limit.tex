\subsection{Maximum Growth Rate is Determined by the Ribosomal Mass Fraction}
We begin by considering the length of time needed to replicate a single
ribosome. As mentioned in our discussion of rRNA synthesis, the bacterial
ribosome is approximately 2/3 RNA by mass, with the remaining 1/3 being composed
of protein. Of the $\approx$ 50 ribosomal subunits, all are present as a single
copy save for RplL which is present in four copies. Taking these proteins
together, a single ribosome is composed of $L_R \approx$ 7500 individual amino
acids, approximately equal to the number of peptide bonds. Again assuming a
reasonable translation rate of $r_t \approx$ 15 amino acids per second, we arrive at
an simple estimate that it takes on the order of  $L_R / r_t \approx$ 7 minutes to
translate a single ribosome. This limit, as remarked upon by others
\citep{dill2011}, serves as a hard limit for how quickly \textit{E. coli} could
replicate. As each ribosome would therefore need to copy itself, this  7 minute
speed limit is independent of the number of ribosomes per cell
(\FIG{ribosome_limit}(A)), yet assumes that the only proteins that need
to be replicated for division to occur are ribosomal proteins, a regime we know is not met in
biological reality. 

However, we can consider the translation limited growth rate as a function of
the fraction $\Phi_R$ of the total number of amino acids in the proteome $N_\text{pep}$
that are sequestered in a ribosome, $N_\text{pep}^\text{(ribosome)}$. To compute this quantity, we
note that the number of amino acids in a ribosome is related to the protein mass
via 
\begin{equation}
  m_\text{ribosome} \approx L_R \times m_\text{AA}
  \label{eq:mribo}
\end{equation}
where $m_\text{AA}$ is the average mass of an amino acid which is $\approx$ 110
Da (BNID: 104877). Similarly, we can compute the mass of the total cellular
proteome as 
\begin{equation}
  m_\text{proteome} \approx N_\text{pep} \teims m_\text{AA}.
  \label{eq:mproteome}
\end{equation}

Together, \EQ{mribo} and \EQ{mproteome} allow us to define the ribosomal mass
fraction as 
\begin{equation}
  \Phi_R = \frac{m_\text{ribosome} \times R}{m_\text{proteome}} \approx \frac{R \times L_R}{N_\text{pep}}.
  \label{eq:phir}
\end{equation}
Relating the number of peptide bonds to be synthesized to complete division to
the number of ribosomes per cell in this manner allows us to enumerate an
expression for translation-limited growth. As cells grow exponentially in time
\cite{godin2010}, the rate of cellular growth can be computed as 
\begin{equation}
N_\text{pep} \lambda = r_t \times R \times f_a,
\label{eq:exp_cell_growth}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the cellular growth rate and $f_a$ is a multiplicative factor
which describes the fraction of ribosomes actively translating. This latter term
allows us to account for the possibility of nonfunctional, immature ribosomes or
active sequestration of ribosomes through small-molecule alarmones such as
(p)ppGpp which can be significant at slow growth rates \citep{dennis2004,
dai2016}. Combining \EQ{phir} and \EQ{exp_cell_growth} yields an expression for
the translation limited growth rate 
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\text{translation-limited} \approx \frac{r_t}{L_R}\Phi_Rf_a.
\label{eq:lam_lim}
\end{equation}

This expression is plotted in the top panel of \FIG{limit}(B) assuming $f_a =
1$. When $\Phi_R \approx 1$ (i.e. when all proteins in the cell are ribosomal),
the maximum growth rate corresponds to the speed limit of $\approx$ 7 min,
illustrated by a dashed line in the top panel of \FIG{limit}(B). As the product
$f_a \times \Phi_R$ is
decreased, meaning the ribosomes occupy a smaller and smaller proportion of the
proteome, we observe that the growth similarly decreases. To make a connection
with the proteomic data, we require a means to estimate $f_a$ at each growth
rate. Recent measurements by \cite{dai2016} reveal that $f_a \approx 1$ at fast
growth rates ($>$ 0.75 hr$^{-1}$) and monotonically decreases as slower growth
rates (\FIG{limit} (B), inset in bottom plot). Using these data, we estimated
$f_a$ for each growth rate present in the proteomic data set. In general, these
data appear to skirt this translation limited growth regime as growth conditions
change (\FIG{limit}(B), colored points in bottom plot). There is a notable
discrepancy between the data collected in \cite{schmidt2016, li2014} and that
collected from \cite{valgepea2013, peebo2015}. When compared to other,
non-proteomic wide measurements of the active ribosome mass fraction
(\FIG{limit} (B), grey points in bottom plot), the data from \cite{valgepea2013}
and \cite{peebo2015} are notably aberrant, suggesting a systematic error in
these data. 


The translation-limited view of growth defined \EQ{lam_lim} reflects
mass-balance under steady state growth and has long provided a rationalization
of the apparent linear increase in \textit{E. coli}'s ribosomal content as a
function growth rate \cite{goldberger1979,schaechter1958,scott2010}. While this
is a useful framework to approximately consider how the relative abundance of ribosomes
(compared to all other proteins) defines the growth rate, it is worth noting
that as growth rate increases, so does the cell size and therefore so must the
proteome mass. With a handle on how elongation rate and the total number of
peptide bonds per proteome is related to the growth rate, we now expand this
description to account for the changing cell size, allowing us to consider a
potential bottleneck in the synthesis of rRNA.

% To  gain some intuition into how ribosomal synthesis influences
% bacterial growth, we again consider the total number of peptide bonds that must
% be synthesized, which we denote as $N_\text{pep}$. With cells growing exponentially in time
% \citep{godin2010}, the rate of cellular growth will be related to the rate of protein synthesis by
% \begin{equation}
%     N_\text{pep} \lambda = r_t R f_a,
%     \label{eq:mass_balance}
% \end{equation}
% where $\lambda$ is the cell growth rate,  $r_t$ is the maximum
% elongation rate in AA per second, and $R$ is the average ribosome copy
% number per cell. The multiplicative factor $f_a$ refers to the fraction of
% ribosomes actively translating, and allows us to account for the possibility of
% nonfunctional, immature ribosomes or active sequestration of ribosomes, mediated
% by the secondary-messenger molecule alarmones, such as guanosine pentaphosphate
% [(p)ppGpp] at slow growth \citep{dennis2004, dai2016}.

% Rather than speaking in terms of absolute ribosome abundance, we can account for
% the ribosome content as was defined by \cite{scott2010} as the mass of fraction
% of the proteome occupied by ribosomes $\Phi_R$. Similarly, as $N_\text{pep}$ is related to
% the total protein mass through the molecular weight of each protein, we can also consider the growth
% rate in terms of the fraction of the total proteome mass dedicated to ribosomal
% proteins. By making the approximation that an average amino acid has a molecular
% weight of 110 Da (BNID: 104877), the total protein mass $m_\text{protein}$ is
% related to $N_\text{pep}$ by $(m_\text{protein}/\text{110 Da}) \times N_A$,
% where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number. Similarly, $R$ is related to the ribosomal
% protein mass by $R \approx (m_R/\text{800 Da}) \times N_A$, where 800 Da
% reflects the summed molecular weight of all ribosomal subunits.  This allows us
% to approximate  $R / N_\text{pep} \approx \Phi_R / L_R$,  where $\Phi_R$ is the
% ribosomal mass fraction $m_\text{protein}/m_R$, and $L_R$ the ratio of 800 kDa /
% 110 Da per amino acid or, alternatively, the total length in amino acids that
% make up a ribosome. Under this parameterization, the translation-limited growth rate can then be written in
% the form
% \begin{equation}
% \lambda_{\textrm{translation-limited}} \approx \frac{r_t}{L_R}  \Phi_R f_a.
% \label{eq:translation_limit_growth_rate}
% \end{equation}
% This is plotted as a function of the ribosomal fraction $\Phi_R$ in the top panel of
% \FIG{ribosome_limit}(A), where we take $L_R \approx$ 7500 AA, corresponding to
% the length in amino acids for all ribosomal subunits of the 50S and 30S complex
% (BNID: 101175), and $f_a$ = 1. To compare this relationship to the proteomic
% data, we make use of recent measurements of $f_a$ from \cite{dai2016}
% (\FIG{ribosome_limit}(A), bottom inset) to estimate the active
% fraction of ribosomal protein across each proteomic data set
% (\FIG{ribosome_limit}(A), colored points, bottom). In general, the data appear to
% skirt this limit in growth rate as nutrient conditions vary. There is a notable discrepancy
% in the data from \cite{peebo2015, valgepea2013}, where cells appear to grow
% substantially slower given their estimated ribosomal fraction. Here we have
% also collected a number of recent non-proteomic measurements of ribosomal fraction and
% find them most consistent with the measurements from \cite{li2014,
% schmidt2016} (gray points; also see \FIGSUPP[ribosome_limit]{ribosome_limit_supp}(A)).

% The growth rate defined by \EQ{translation_limit_growth_rate} reflects
% mass-balance under steady state growth and has long provided a rationalization
% of the apparent linear increase in \textit{E. coli}'s ribosomal content as a
% function of growth rate \citep{goldberger1979, scott2010}. The maximum rate,
% when $\Phi_R$ = 1, could only be achieved if a cell contained only ribosomes \citep{dill2011}.
% This corresponds to the synthesis time of all ribosomal subunits, $L_R/ r_t
% \approx$ 7 minutes and interestingly, is independent of the
% absolute number of ribosomes (\FIG{ribosome_limit}(B)). To return to our earlier comments on
% parallelization, it is this step that is rate-limiting, with each ribosome being
% required to produce a second ribosome. Unless elongation rate increased, or
% cells could trim their total ribosomal protein mass, this dependency limits both
% the maximum growth rate (when $\Phi_R$ = 1), and also the achieveable growth
% rate under more moderate values of $\Phi_R$.

\subsection{rRNA Synthesis Presents a Potential Bottleneck during Rapid Growth}
\textit{E. coli} rarely exhibits growth rates above 2 hr$^{-1}$
\citep{bremer2008}, which is still well-below the synthesis rate of a single
ribosome, and below the growth rates reported for several other bacteria
\citep{roller2016}. Here we need to also consider ribosomal synthesis from the
perspective of limiting rRNA synthesis, which as we have found earlier, will depend on the
number of rRNA operons to transcribe rRNA.

Due to multiple rounds of chromosomal replication per cell doubling, the
effective number of rRNA operons increases with growth rate and will vary in
proportion to the average number of origins per cell, $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$.
This parameter is set by how often replication must be initiated per cell
doubling in order to maintain steady state growth, and quantified by
\begin{equation}
    \langle \text{\# ori} \rangle = 2^{\tau_{cyc} / \tau} = 2^{\tau_{cyc} \lambda / ln(2)}.
    \label{eq:Nori}
\end{equation}
Here, $t_{cyc}$ is the cell cycle time (referring to the time from replication
initiation to cell division), and $\tau$ is the cell doubling time.  We used the
experimental measurements of $\tau_{cyc}$ and  $\tau$ from \cite{si2017}
(\FIGSUPP[ribosome_limit]{ribosome_limit_supp}(B)) to calculate $\langle$\#
ori$\rangle$  with \EQ{Nori} as a function of growth rates. For growth rates
above about 0.5 hr$^{-1}$, $t_{cyc}$ is approximately constant at about 70
minutes, which means that $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$ will grow exponentially with
growth rate. Since the rRNA operons are predominantly located near to origin of
replication  (BNID: 100352, \cite{dennis2004}), we make the simplifying
assumption that that the number of rRNA operons  will be directly proportional
to $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$.

Returning to our rule-of-thumb of 1 functional rRNA unit per second per operon,
we estimate the maximum number of ribosomes that could be made as a function of
growth rate (\FIG{ribosome_limit}(C), blue curve). Although we expect this
estimate to drastically overestimate rRNA abundance at slower growth rates
($\lambda < 0.5\, \text{hr}^{-1}$), it provides a useful reference alongside the
proteomic measurements. For growth rates above about 1 hr$^{-1}$, we find that
cells will \textit{need} to transcribe rRNA near their maximal rate. As a counter
example, if \textit{E. coli} did not initiate multiple rounds of replication,
they would be unable to make enough rRNA for the observed number of ribosomes
(dashed blue curve in \FIG{ribosome_limit}(C)). The convergence between the
maximum rRNA production and measured ribosome copy number suggests rRNA
synthesis may begin to present a bottleneck at the fastest growth rates due to
the still-limited copies of rRNA genes.


% It is now well-documented that \textit{E. coli} cells add a constant volume per
% origin of replication, which is robust to a remarkable array of cellular
% perturbations \citep{si2017}.

% To consider
% this  in the context of the proteomic data, we used measurements of $\tau_{cyc}$
% and  $\tau$ from \cite{si2017} (\FIG{translation_ecoli_partA}(A)) to
% calculate $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$  with \EQ{Nori} at different growth
% rates. For ribosomal synthesis, we find an approximately linear correlation
% between ribosome copy number and $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$
% (\FIG{translation_ecoli_partA}(B)).
%
% For a constant cell cycle time, which is observed at growth rates above about
% 0.5 hr$^{-1}$ (\FIG{translation_ecoli_partA}(A), \citep{helmstetter1968}),
% \EQ{Nori} states that $\langle \text{\# ori} \rangle$ will need to increase
% exponentially with the growth rate.
