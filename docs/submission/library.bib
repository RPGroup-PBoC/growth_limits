  abstract = {Bacterial growth is crucially dependent on protein synthesis and thus on the cellular abundance of ribosomes and related proteins. Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

  abstract = {A grand challenge of systems biology is to predict the kinetic responses of living systems to perturbations starting from the underlying molecular interactions. Changes in the nutrient environment have long been used to study regulation and adaptation phenomena in microorganisms1,2,3 and they remain a topic of active investigation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Although much is known about the molecular interactions that govern the regulation of key metabolic processes in response to applied perturbations12,13,14,15,16,17, they are insufficiently quantified for predictive bottom-up modelling. Here we develop a top-down approach, expanding the recently established coarse-grained proteome allocation models15,18,19,20 from steady-state growth into the kinetic regime. Using only qualitative knowledge of the underlying regulatory processes and imposing the condition of flux balance, we derive a quantitative model of bacterial growth transitions that is independent of inaccessible kinetic parameters. The resulting flux-controlled regulation model accurately predicts the time course of gene expression and biomass accumulation in response to carbon upshifts and downshifts (for example, diauxic shifts) without adjustable parameters. As predicted by the model and validated by quantitative proteomics, cells exhibit suboptimal recovery kinetics in response to nutrient shifts owing to a rigid strategy of protein synthesis allocation, which is not directed towards alleviating specific metabolic bottlenecks. Our approach does not rely on kinetic parameters, and therefore points to a theoretical framework for describing a broad range of such kinetic processes without detailed knowledge of the underlying biochemical reactions.},

  abstract = {An enduring mystery of evolutionary genomics concerns the mechanisms responsible for lineage-specific expansions of genome size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular species. One idea is that all excess DNA is mutationally hazardous, but weakly enough so that genome-size expansion passively emerges in species experiencing relatively low efficiency of selection owing to small effective population sizes. Another idea is that substantial gene additions were impossible without the energetic boost provided by the colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic lineage. Contrary to this latter view, analysis of cellular energetics and genomics data from a wide variety of species indicates that, relative to the lifetime ATP requirements of a cell, the costs of a gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels decline with cell volume in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Moreover, these costs are usually sufficiently large to be perceived by natural selection in bacterial populations, but not in eukaryotes experiencing high levels of random genetic drift. Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by virtue of their large size alone, eukaryotic cells are subject to a broader set of opportunities for the colonization of novel genes manifesting weakly advantageous or even transiently disadvantageous phenotypic effects. These results indicate that the origin of the mitochondrion was not a prerequisite for genome-size expansion.},

It was assumed that the chemical composition of the cell was the same under all these conditions. The analysis of the chemical composition of microbial cells of Morowitz (1968) was taken as a base. It was assumed that 4 moles of ATP are required for the incorporation of one mole of amino acid into protein. The amount of ATP required on account of the instability and frequent regeneration of messenger RNA was calculated from data in the literature pertaining to the relative rates of synthesis of the various classes of RNA molecules in the cell. An estimate is given of the amount of ATP required for transport processes. For this purpose it was assumed that 0.5 mole of ATP is necessary for the uptake of 1 g-ion of potassium or ammonium, and 1 mole of ATP for the uptake of 1 mole of phosphate, amino acid, acetate, malate etc. The results of the calculations show that from preformed monomers (glucose, amino acids and nucleic acid bases) 31.9 g cells can be formed per g-mole of ATP when acetyl-CoA is formed from glucose. When acetyl-CoA cannot be formed from glucose and must be formed from acetate, YATPMAXis only 26.4. For growth with glucose and inorganic salts a YATPMAXvalue of 28.8 was found. Addition of amino acids was without effect on YATPMAXbut addition of nucleic acid bases increased the YATPMAXvalue to that for cells growing with preformed monomers. Under these conditions 15\textendash 20\% of the total ATP required for cell formation is used for transport processes. Much lower YATPMAXvalues are found for growth with malate, lactate or acetate and inorganic salts. During growth on these substrates a greater part of the ATP required for cell formation is used for transport processes. The calculated figures are very close to the experimental values found.},

BioNumbers was motivated by an appreciation of how long it can take to find even the simplest number in the vast biological literature. All numbers are taken directly from a literature source and that reference is provided with the number. BioNumbers is designed to be highly searchable and queries can be performed by keywords or browsed by menus. BioNumbers is a collaborative community platform where registered users can add content and make comments on existing data. All new entries and commentary are curated to maintain high quality. Here we describe the database characteristics and implementation, demonstrate its use, and discuss future directions for its development.},

  abstract = {Bacterial physiology is a branch of biology that aims to understand overarching principles of cellular reproduction. Many important issues in bacterial physiology are inherently quantitative, and major contributors to the field have often brought together tools and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. This article presents a comprehensive overview of major ideas and approaches developed since the early 20th century for anyone who is interested in the fundamental problems in bacterial physiology. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part (sections 1\textendash{}3), we review the first `golden era' of bacterial physiology from the 1940s to early 1970s and provide a complete list of major references from that period. In the second part (sections 4\textendash{}7), we explain how the pioneering work from the first golden era has influenced various rediscoveries of general quantitative principles and significant further development in modern bacterial physiology. Specifically, section 4 presents the history and current progress of the `adder' principle of cell size homeostasis. Section 5 discusses the implications of coarsegraining the cellular protein composition, and how the coarse-grained proteome `sectors' re-balance under different growth conditions. Section 6 focuses on physiological invariants, and explains how they are the key to understanding the coordination between growth and the cell cycle underlying cell size control in steady-state growth. Section 7 overviews how the temporal organization of all the internal processes enables balanced growth. In the final section 8, we conclude by discussing the remaining challenges for the future in the field.},

  abstract = {Metabolic network models describing growth of Escherichia coli on glucose, glycerol and acetate were derived from a genome scale model of E. coli. One of the uncertainties in the metabolic networks is the exact stoichiometry of energy generating and consuming processes. Accurate estimation of biomass and product yields requires correct information on the ATP stoichiometry. The unknown ATP stoichiometry parameters of the constructed E. coli network were estimated from experimental data of eight different aerobic chemostat experiments carried out with E. coli MG1655, grown at different dilution rates (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 h-1) and on different carbon substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetate). Proper estimation of the ATP stoichiometry requires proper information on the biomass composition of the organism as well as accurate assessment of net conversion rates under well-defined conditions. For this purpose a growth rate dependent biomass composition was derived, based on measurements and literature data. After incorporation of the growth rate dependent biomass composition in a metabolic network model, an effective P/O ratio of 1.49 {$\pm$} 0.26 mol of ATP/mol of O, KX (growth dependent maintenance) of 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.27 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass and mATP (growth independent maintenance) of 0.075 {$\pm$} 0.015 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass/h were estimated using a newly developed Comprehensive Data Reconciliation (CDR) method, assuming that the three energetic parameters were independent of the growth rate and the used substrate. The resulting metabolic network model only requires the specific rate of growth, \textmu, as an input in order to accurately predict all other fluxes and yields. Biotechnol.

Escherichia coli in the late exponential phase of growth and early stationary phase (glucose limited) had an average dry matter content of 278 and 154 fg/cell, respectively. Of the elements detected, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, potassium, and calcium together made up 15 to 17\% of the dry matter content. A phosphorus content of 4.2 to 5.4\% of the dry matter was found in these cells. Volume measurements of air-dried cells gave an average of 1.20 to 1.25 micron3.

Examination of the genome suggests that many more will be found, especially genes involved in regulation, scavenging of sulfur containing molecules and synthesis of coenzymes or prosthetic groups. Furthermore, the involvement of methionine as the universal start of proteins as well as that of its derivative Sadenosylmethionine in a vast variety of cell processes argue in favour of a major importance of sulfur metabolism in all organisms.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a biologically potent molecule, and the regulation of ammonia levels in the mammalian body is, therefore, strictly controlled. The molecular paths of ammonia permeation across plasma membranes remain ill-defined, but the structural similarity of water and NH3 has pointed to the aquaporins as putative NH3-permeable pores. Accordingly, a range of aquaporins from mammals, plants, fungi, and protozoans demonstrates ammonia permeability. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is highly expressed at perivascular glia end-feet in the mammalian brain and may, with this prominent localization at the blood-brain-interface, participate in the exchange of ammonia, which is required to sustain the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Here we observe that AQP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes display a reflection coefficient {$<$}1 for NH4Cl at pH 8.0, at which pH an increased amount of the ammonia occurs in the form of NH3. Taken together with an NH4Cl-mediated intracellular alkalization (or lesser acidification) of AQP4-expressing oocytes, these data suggest that NH3 is able to permeate the pore of AQP4. Exposure to NH4Cl increased the membrane currents to a similar extent in uninjected oocytes and in oocytes expressing AQP4, indicating that the ionic NH4+ did not permeate AQP4. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed partial pore permeation events of NH3 but not of NH4+ and a reduced energy barrier for NH3 permeation through AQP4 compared with that of a cholesterol-containing lipid bilayer, suggesting AQP4 as a favored transmembrane route for NH3. Our data propose that AQP4 belongs to the growing list of NH3-permeable water channels.},

A comparison of these strains showed that one of the systems (PIT) was fully constitutive, required no binding protein, and operated in spheroplasts. It permitted the complete exchange of intracellular phosphate with extracellular phosphate (or arsenate) and was completely inhibited by uncouplers. The other system, PST, was repressible by phosphate concentrations above 1 mM, required the phosphate-binding protein for full activity, and did not operate in spheroplasts. It catalyzed very little exchange between internal and external phosphate and was resistant to uncouplers. The maximal velocities attained by the two systems were approximately the same, but the affinity for phosphate in the PST system was greater by two orders of magnitude. In strains in which both systems were fully operative, the initial rates of uptake was nearly additive, and the systems appeared to interact with a common intracellular phosphate pool.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate\textendash{}carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is responsible for the transport and phosphorylation of sugars, such as glucose. PTS activity has a crucial role in the global signaling system that controls the preferential consumption of glucose over other carbon sources. When the cell is exposed to carbohydrate mixtures, the PTS prevents the expression of catabolic genes and activity of non-PTS sugars transport systems by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This process defines some metabolic and physiological constraints that must be considered during the development of production strains. In this review, we summarize the importance of the PTS in controlling and influencing both PTS and non-PTS sugar transport processes as well as the mechanisms of transcriptional control involved in the expression of catabolic genes of non-PTS sugars in E. coli. We discuss three main approaches applied efficiently to avoid these constraints resulting in obtaining PTS- glc+ mutants useful for production purposes: (1) adaptive selection in chemostat culture system of PTS- mutants, resulting in the selection of strains that recovered the ability to grow in glucose, along with the simultaneous consumption of two carbon sources and reduced acetate production; (2) replacement in PTS- strains of the native GalP promoter by strong promoters or the substitution of this permease by recombinant glucose transport system; and (3) enhancement of Crp (crp+) in mgsA, pgi, and ptsG mutants, resulting in derivative strains that abolished CCR, allowing the simultaneous consumption of mixtures of sugars with low acetate production.},

Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavailable carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the environment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving conditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymerase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activation. Significant differences in RNAP distribution in vivo, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent protein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-specific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacterial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior.},

We introduce a new method (Reg-Seq) linking a massively-parallel reporter assay and mass spectrometry to produce a base pair resolution dissection of more than 100 promoters in E. coli in 12 different growth conditions. First, we show that our method recapitulates regulatory information from known sequences. Then, we examine the regulatory architectures for more than 80 promoters in the E. coli genome which previously had no known regulation. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate their regulation. The method introduced here clears a path for fully characterizing the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving on to an array of other microbes of ecological and medical relevance.},

However, while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here, we take a first step toward multipromoter dissection and show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect multiple bacterial promoters in a systematic way. We show this approach on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases, we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input\textendash{}output relationships. Given the generality of the approach presented here, it opens up the possibility of quantitatively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli contains two major systems for transporting inorganic phosphate (Pi). The low-affinity Pi transporter (pitA) is expressed constitutively and is dependent on the proton motive force, while the high-affinity Pst system (pstSCAB) is induced at low external Pi concentrations by the phoregulon and is an ABC transporter. We isolated a third putative Pi transport gene, pitB, from E. coli K-12 and present evidence that pitB encodes a functional Pi transporter that may be repressed at low Pi levels by the pho regulon. While apitB+ cosmid clone allowed growth on medium containing 500 {$\mu$}M Pi, E. coli with wild-type genomic pitB (pitA{$\Delta$}pstC345 double mutant) was unable to grow under these conditions, making it indistinguishable from a pitA pitB{$\Delta$}pstC345 triple mutant. The mutation {$\Delta$}pstC345 constitutively activates thepho regulon, which is normally induced by phosphate starvation. Removal of pho regulation by deleting thephoB-phoR operon allowed thepitB+pitA{$\Delta$}pstC345 strain to utilize Pi, with Pi uptake rates significantly higher than background levels. In addition, the apparent Kmof PitB decreased with increased levels of protein expression, suggesting that there is also regulation of the PitB protein. Strain K-10 contains a nonfunctional pitA gene and lacks Pit activity when the Pst system is mutated. The pitAmutation was identified as a single base change, causing an aspartic acid to replace glycine 220. This mutation greatly decreased the amount of PitA protein present in cell membranes, indicating that the aspartic acid substitution disrupts protein structure.},

Our results suggest that CysZ is dedicated to a specific pathway that assimilates sulfate for the synthesis of cysteine. Sulfate uptake via CysZ into E. coli whole cells and proteoliposome offers direct evidence of CysZ being able to mediate sulfate uptake. In addition, the cysteine synthesis pathway intermediate sulfite can interact directly with CysZ with higher affinity than sulfate. The sulfate transport activity is inhibited in the presence of sulfite, suggesting the existence of a feedback inhibition mechanism in which sulfite regulates sulfate uptake by CysZ. Sulfate uptake assays performed at different extracellular pH and in the presence of a proton uncoupler indicate that this uptake is driven by the proton gradient.},

Also, there are diverse results which and how quinones (oxidised/reduced, ubiquinone/other quinones) are controlling the ArcBA two-component system. In the following a mathematical model of the E. coli ETC linked to basic modules for substrate uptake, fermentation product excretion and biomass formation is introduced. The kinetic modelling focusses on regulatory principles of the ETC for varying oxygen conditions in glucose-limited continuous cultures. The model is based on the balance of electron donation (glucose) and acceptance (oxygen or other acceptors). Also, it is able to account for different chemostat conditions due to changed substrate concentrations and dilution rates. The parameter identification process is divided into an estimation and a validation step based on previously published and new experimental data. The model shows that experimentally observed, qualitatively different behaviour of the ubiquinone redox state and the ArcA activity profile in the micro-aerobic range for different experimental conditions can emerge from a single network structure. The network structure features a strong feed-forward effect from the FNR regulatory system to the ArcBA regulatory system via a common control of the dehydrogenases of the ETC. The model supports the hypothesis that ubiquinone but not ubiquinol plays a key role in determining the activity of ArcBA in a glucose-limited chemostat at micro-aerobic conditions.},

  abstract = {1. The function of ubiquinone in Escherichia coli was studied by using whole cells and membrane preparations of normal E. coli and of a mutant lacking ubiquinone. 2. The mutant lacking ubiquinone, strain AN59 (Ubi-), when grown under aerobic conditions, gave an anaerobic type of growth yield and produced large quantities of lactic acid, indicating that ubiquinone plays a vital role in electron transport. 3. NADH and lactate oxidase activities in membranes from strain AN59 (Ubi-) were greatly impaired and activity was restored by the addition of ubiquinone (Q-1). 4. Comparison of the percentage reduction of flavin, cytochrome b1 and cytochrome a2 in the aerobic steady state in membranes from the normal strain (AN62) and strain AN59 (Ubi-) and the effect of respiratory inhibitors on these percentages in membranes from strain AN62 suggest that ubiquinone functions at more than one site in the electron-transport chain. 5. Membranes from strain AN62, in the absence of substrate, showed an electron-spin-resonance signal attributed to ubisemiquinone. The amount of reduced ubiquinone (50\%) found after rapid solvent extraction is consistent with the existence of ubiquinone in membranes as a stabilized ubisemiquinone. 6. The effects of piericidin A on membranes from strain AN62 suggest that this inhibitor acts at the ubiquinone sites: thus inhibition of electron transport is reversed by ubiquinone (Q-1); the aerobic steady-state oxidation\textendash reduction levels of flavins and cytochrome b1 in the presence of the inhibitor are raised to values approximating those found in the membranes of strain AN59 (Ubi-); the inhibitor rapidly eliminates the electron-spin-resonance signal attributed to ubisemiquinone and allows slow oxidation of endogenous ubiquinol in the absence of substrate and prevents reduction of ubiquinone in the presence of substrate. It is concluded that piericidin A separates ubiquinone from the remainder of the electron-transport chain. 7. A scheme is proposed in which ubisemiquinone, complexed to an electron carrier, functions in at least two positions in the electron-transport sequence.},

  abstract = {E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to dNDPs and is composed of two homodimeric subunits: R1 and R2. R1 binds NDPs and contains binding sites for allosteric effectors that control substrate specificity and turnover rate. R2 contains a diiron-tyrosyl radical (Y\textbullet ) cofactor that initiates nucleotide reduction. Pre-steady-state experiments with wild type R1 or C754S/C759S-R1 and R2 were carried out to determine which step(s) are rate-limiting and whether both active sites of R1 can catalyze nucleotide reduction. Rapid chemical quench experiments monitoring dCDP formation gave kobs of 9 ( 4 s-1 with an amplitude of 1.7 ( 0.4 equiv. This amplitude, generated in experiments with pre-reduced R1 (3 or 15 \textmu M) in the absence of reductant, indicates that both monomers of R1 are active. Stopped-flow UV-vis spectroscopy monitoring the concentration of the Y\textbullet{} failed to reveal any changes from 2 ms to seconds under similar conditions. These pre-steady-state experiments, in conjunction with the steady-state turnover numbers for dCDP formation of 2-14 s-1 at RNR concentrations of 0.05-0.4 \textmu M (typical assay conditions), reveal that the rate-determining step is a physical step prior to rapid nucleotide reduction and rapid tyrosine reoxidation to Y\textbullet. Steady-state experiments conducted at RNR concentrations of 3 and 15 \textmu M, typical of pre-steady-state conditions, suggest that, in addition to the slow conformational change(s) prior to chemistry, re-reduction of the active site disulfide to dithiol or a conformational change accompanying this process can also be ratelimiting.},

  abstract = {Evolutionarily divergent bacteria share a common phenomenological strategy for cell-size homeostasis under steady-state conditions. In the presence of inherent physiological stochasticity, cells following this ``adder'' principle gradually return to their steady-state size by adding a constant volume between birth and division, regardless of their size at birth. However, the mechanism of the adder has been unknown despite intense efforts. In this work, we show that the adder is a direct consequence of two general processes in biology: (1) threshold\textemdash accumulation of initiators and precursors required for cell division to a respective fixed number\textemdash and (2) balanced biosynthesis\textemdash maintenance of their production proportional to volume growth. This mechanism is naturally robust to static growth inhibition but also allows us to ``reprogram'' cell-size homeostasis in a quantitatively predictive manner in both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. By generating dynamic oscillations in the concentration of the division protein FtsZ, we were able to oscillate cell size at division and systematically break the adder. In contrast, periodic induction of replication initiator protein DnaA caused oscillations in cell size at initiation but did not alter division size or the adder. Finally, we were able to restore the adder phenotype in slow-growing E. coli, the only known steady-state growth condition wherein E. coli significantly deviates from the adder, by repressing active degradation of division proteins. Together, these results show that cell division and replication initiation are independently controlled at the gene-expression level and that division processes exclusively drive cell-size homeostasis in bacteria.},

In contrast, the role of endogenously occurring nucleotide modifications in genome stability is little understood. This is despite the demonstration over three decades ago that the cellular DNA precursor pool is orders of magnitude more susceptible to modification than the DNA molecule itself. More recently, underscoring the importance of this topic, oxidation of the cellular nucleotide pool achieved through targeting the sanitation enzyme MTH1, appears to be a promising anti-cancer strategy. This article reviews our current understanding of modified DNA precursors in genome stability, with a particular focus upon oxidised nucleotides, and outlines some important outstanding questions.},

The relative fitness of these strains was determined in competition experiments in both batch and chemostat cultures. In batch cultures, the decrease in relative fitness corresponded to the number of rRNA operons deleted, which could be accounted for completely by increased lag times and decreased growth rates. The magnitude of the deleterious effect varied with the environment in which fitness was measured: the negative consequences of rRNA operon deletions increased under culture conditions permitting more-rapid growth. The rRNA operon deletion strains were not more effective competitors under the regimen of constant, limited resources provided in chemostat cultures. Enhanced fitness in chemostat cultures would have suggested a simple tradeoff in which deletion strains grew faster (due to more efficient resource utilization) under resource limitation. The contributions of growth rate, lag time, Ks, and death rate to the fitness of each strain were verified through mathematical simulation of competition experiments. These data support the hypothesis that multiple rRNA operons are a component of bacterial life history and that they confer a selective advantage permitting microbes to respond quickly and grow rapidly in environments characterized by fluctuations in resource availability.},

We demonstrate that {$\sigma$}70 can bind in trans to TECs that emanate from either a {$\sigma$}70-dependent promoter or a promoter that is controlled by an alternative {$\sigma$} factor. We further demonstrate that binding of {$\sigma$}70 to the TEC in trans can have a particularly large impact on the dynamics of transcription elongation during stationary phase. Our findings establish a mechanism whereby the primary {$\sigma$} factor can exert direct effects on the composition of the entire transcriptome, not just that portion that is produced under the control of {$\sigma$}70-dependent promoters.},

  abstract = {The frequencies of transcription initiation of regulated and constitutive genes depend on the concentration of free RNA polymerase holoenzyme [Rf] near their promoters. Although RNA polymerase is largely confined to the nucleoid, it is difficult to determine absolute concentrations of [Rf] at particular locations within the nucleoid structure. However, relative concentrations of free RNA polymerase at different growth rates, [Rf]rel, can be estimated from the activities of constitutive promoters. Previous studies indicated that the rrnB P2 promoter is constitutive and that [Rf]rel in the vicinity of rrnB P2 increases with increasing growth rate. Recently it has become possible to directly visualize Rf in growing Escherichia coli cells. Here we examine some of the important issues relating to gene expression based on these new observations. We conclude that: (i) At a growth rate of 2 doublings/h, there are about 1000 free and 2350 non-specifically DNA-bound RNA polymerase molecules per average cell (12 and 28\%, respectively, of 8400 total) which are in rapid equilibrium. (ii) The reversibility of the non-specific binding generates more than 1000 free RNA polymerase molecules every second in the immediate vicinity of the DNA. Of these, most rebind non-specifically to the DNA within a few ms; the frequency of non-specific binding is at least two orders of magnitude greater than specific binding and transcript initiation. (iii) At a given amount of RNA polymerase per cell, [Rf] and the density of non-specifically DNA-bound RNA polymerase molecules along the DNA both vary reciprocally with the amount of DNA in the cell. (iv) At 2 doublings/h an E. coli cell contains, on the average, about 1 non-specifically bound RNA polymerase per 9 kbp of DNA and 1 free RNA polymerase per 20 kbp of DNA. However some DNA regions (i.e. near active rRNA operons) may have significantly higher than average [Rf].},

We report that tethering {$\sigma$}70 to all RNAP molecules via genetic fusion of rpoD to rpoC (encoding {$\sigma$}70 and RNAP's {$\beta{'}$} subunit, respectively) yields viable Escherichia coli strains in which alternative {$\sigma$}-factor function is not impaired. {$\beta{'}$}::{$\sigma$}70 RNAP transcribed DNA normally in vitro, but allowed {$\sigma$}70-dependent pausing at extended -10-like sequences anywhere in a transcriptional unit. Based on measurement of the effective concentration of tethered {$\sigma$}70, we conclude that the effective concentration of {$\sigma$}70 in E. coli (i.e., its thermodynamic activity) is close to its bulk concentration. At this level, {$\sigma$}70 would be a bona fide elongation factor able to direct transcriptional pausing even after its release from RNAP during promoter escape.},

  abstract = {The aquaglyceroporin GlpF is a transmembrane channel of Escherichia coli that facilitates the uptake of glycerol by the cell. Its high glycerol uptake rate is crucial for the cell to survive in very low glycerol concentrations. Although GlpF allows both influx and outflux of glycerol, its structure, similar to the structure of maltoporin, exhibits a significant degree of asymmetry. The potential of mean force characterizing glycerol in the channel shows a corresponding asymmetry with an attractive vestibule only at the periplasmic side. In this study, we analyze the potential of mean force, showing that a simplified six-step model captures the kinetics and yields a glycerol conduction rate that agrees well with observation. The vestibule improves the conduction rate by 40\% and 75\% at 10-mM and 10-mM periplasmic glycerol concentrations, respectively. In addition, neither the conduction rate nor the conduction probability for a single glycerol (efficiency) depends on the orientation of GlpF. GlpF appears to conduct equally well in both directions under physiological conditions.},

Different bacterial species display different membrane compositions and even the membrane composition of cells belonging to a single species is not constant, but depends on the environmental conditions to which the cells are exposed. Bacterial membranes present a large diversity of amphiphilic lipids, including the common phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, the less frequent phospholipids phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol and a variety of other membrane lipids, such as for example ornithine lipids, glycolipids, sphingolipids or hopanoids among others.

Unfortunately, to date, many of these systems have proven difficult to engineer without a detailed understanding of the kinetic relationships that regulate the concerted action of their constituent enzymes. This study develops a mechanistic kinetic model of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) of Escherichia coli and uses that model to determine how different FAS components work together to control the production of free fatty acids\textemdash precursors to a wide range of oleochemicals. Perturbational analyses indicate that the modification or overexpression of a single FAS component can depress fatty acid production (a commonly observed phenomenon) by sequestering the proteins with which it interacts and/or by depleting common substrate pools. Compositional studies, in turn, suggest that simple changes in the ratios of FAS components can alter the average length of fatty acids but show that specialized enzymes (i.e., highly specific ketoacyl synthases or thioesterases) are required for narrow product profiles. Intriguingly, a sensitivity analysis indicates that two components primarily influence\textemdash and, thus, enable fine control over\textemdash total production, but suggests that the enzymes that regulate product profile are more broadly influential. Findings thus reveal the general importance of kinetic considerations in efforts to engineer fatty acid biosynthesis and provide strategies\textemdash and a kinetic model\textemdash for incorporating those considerations into FAS designs.},

  abstract = {Increasing demands for petroleum have stimulated sustainable ways to produce chemicals and biofuels. Specifically, fatty acids of varying chain lengths (C6\textendash C16) naturally synthesized in many organisms are promising starting points for the catalytic production of industrial chemicals and diesel-like biofuels. However, bio-production of fatty acids from plants and other microbial production hosts relies heavily on manipulating tightly regulated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. In addition, precursors for fatty acids are used along other central metabolic pathways for the production of amino acids and biomass, which further complicates the engineering of microbial hosts for higher yields. Here, we demonstrate an iterative metabolic engineering effort that integrates computationally driven predictions and metabolic flux analysis techniques to meet this challenge. The OptForce procedure was used for suggesting and prioritizing genetic manipulations that overproduce fatty acids of different chain lengths from C6 to C16 starting with wild-type E. coli. We identified some common but mostly chain-specific genetic interventions alluding to the possibility of fine-tuning overproduction for specific fatty acid chain lengths. In accordance with the OptForce prioritization of interventions, fabZ and acyl-ACP thioesterase were upregulated and fadD was deleted to arrive at a strain that produces 1.70g/L and 0.14g fatty acid/g glucose ({$\sim$}39\% maximum theoretical yield) of C14\textendash 16 fatty acids in minimal M9 medium. These results highlight the benefit of using computational strain design and flux analysis tools in the design of recombinant strains of E. coli to produce free fatty acids.},

  abstract = {Microbial fatty acid derivatives are emerging as promising alternatives to fossil fuel derived transportation fuels. Among bacterial fatty acid synthases (FAS), the Escherichia coli FAS is perhaps the most well studied, but little is known about its steady-state kinetic behavior. Here we describe the reconstitution of E. coli FAS using purified protein components and report detailed kinetic analysis of this reconstituted system. When all ketosynthases are present at 1 {$\mu$}M, the maximum rate of free fatty acid synthesis of the FAS exceeded 100 {$\mu$}M/ min. The steady-state turnover frequency was not significantly inhibited at high concentrations of any substrate or cofactor. FAS activity was saturated with respect to most individual protein components when their concentrations exceeded 1 {$\mu$}M. The exceptions were FabI and FabZ, which increased FAS activity up to concentrations of 10 {$\mu$}M; FabH and FabF, which decreased FAS activity at concentrations higher than 1 {$\mu$}M; and holo-ACP and TesA, which gave maximum FAS activity at 30 {$\mu$}M concentrations. Analysis of the S36T mutant of the ACP revealed that the unusual dependence of FAS activity on holo-ACP concentration was due, at least in part, to the acyl-phosphopantetheine moiety. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction mixture further revealed medium and long chain fatty acyl-ACP intermediates as predominant ACP species. We speculate that one or more of such intermediates are key allosteric regulators of FAS turnover. Our findings provide a new basis for assessing the scope and limitations of using E. coli as a biocatalyst for the production of diesel-like fuels.},

However, the mechanism by which cytoplasmic MreB is linked to extracytoplasmic cell wall synthesis and the function of this linkage for morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane protein RodZ mediates MreB rotation by directly or indirectly coupling MreB to cell wall synthesis enzymes. Furthermore, we map the RodZ domains that link MreB to cell wall synthesis and identify mreB mutants that suppress the shape defect of {$\Delta$}rodZ without restoring rotation, uncoupling rotation from rod-like growth. Surprisingly, MreB rotation is dispensable for rod-like shape determination under standard laboratory conditions but is required for the robustness of rod shape and growth under conditions of cell wall stress.},

By re-engineering peptidoglycan synthesis, we have constructed a continuous spectrophotometric assay for transpeptidation of native or near native peptidoglycan precursors and fragments by Escherichia coli PBP1B, allowing us to (a) identify recognition elements of transpeptidase substrates, (b) reveal a novel mechanism of stereochemical editing within peptidoglycan transpeptidation, (c) assess the impact of peptidoglycan substrates on {$\beta$}-lactam targeting of transpeptidation, and (d) demonstrate that both substrates have to be bound before transpeptidation occurs.

We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence).},

A previously unrecognized growth law, and an invariant of bacterial growth, also follow from our analysis. The growth law reveals that the ratio between the number of ribosomes and the number of polymerases making ribosomal RNA is proportional to the cellular doubling time. The invariant is conserved across growth conditions and specifies how key microscopic parameters in the cell, such as transcription and translation rates, are coupled to cellular physiology. Quantitative predictions from the growth law and invariant are shown to be in excellent agreement with E. coli data despite having no fitting parameters.

Since essential genes control the most fundamental processes of bacterial life, this is a glaring deficiency. To address this limitation, we developed a procedure for transposon insertion mutant sequencing that includes essential genes. The method, called transformation transposon insertion mutant sequencing (TFNseq), employs saturation-level libraries of bacterial mutants generated by natural transformation with chromosomal DNA mutagenized heavily by in vitro transposition. The efficient mutagenesis makes it possible to detect large numbers of insertions in essential genes immediately after transformation and to follow their loss during subsequent growth. It was possible to order 45 essential processes based on how rapidly their inactivation inhibited growth. Inactivating ATP production, deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, or ribosome production blocked growth the fastest, whereas inactivating cell division or outer membrane protein synthesis blocked it the slowest. Individual mutants deleted of essential loci formed microcolonies of nongrowing cells whose sizes were generally consistent with the TFNseq ordering. The sensitivity of essential functions to genetic inactivation provides a metric for ranking their relative importance for bacterial replication and growth. Highly sensitive functions could represent attractive antibiotic targets since even partial inhibition should reduce growth.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
