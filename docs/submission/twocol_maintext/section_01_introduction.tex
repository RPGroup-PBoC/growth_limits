\section{Introduction}
The observed range of bacterial growth rates is enormously diverse. In natural
environments, some microbial organisms may double only once per year
\citep{mikucki2009} while in comfortable laboratory conditions, growth can be
rapid with several divisions per hour \citep{schaechter1958}. This six
order-of-magnitude difference in time scales of growth encompasses different
microbial species and lifestyles, yet even for a single species such as
\textit{Escherichia coli}, the growth rate can be modulated over a
large scale by tuning the type and amount of nutrients in the growth medium
\citep{liu2005a}. This remarkable plasticity in growth rate illustrates the
intimate relationship between environmental conditions and the rates at which
cells convert nutrients into new cellular material -- a relationship that has
remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a century
\citep{jun2018}.

A key discovery in bacterial physiology of the past 70 years was the
identification of bacterial "growth laws" \citep{schaechter1958}; empirical
relationships that relate the bacterial growth rate to the protein and RNA
composition of the intracellular milieu in a number of different species. Over
the past decade, a flurry of work \citep{molenaar2009, scott2010, klumpp2014,
basan2015, dai2016, erickson2017} has examined these growth laws at a
quantitative level, developing a series of phenomenological models from which
the growth laws naturally emerge. In parallel, a "molecular revolution" in
biology has yielded an increasingly refined molecular census of the cell,
particularly for bacteria such as the microbial workhorse \textit{E. coli}
\citep{schmidt2016, davidi2016a}. In light of the now expansive trove of
quantitative biological data, we can revisit several of the evergreen questions
about bacterial growth and physiology that were originally raised by
microbiologists in the middle of the 20th century. Specifically, what biological
processes are the primary determinants for how quickly bacterial cells can grow
and reproduce? Why do cells modulate the absolute numbers and relative ratios of
their molecular constituents in response to changes in growth rate or nutrient
availability? These questions remain under intense inquiry and have implicated
processes ranging from ribosomal biogenesis and transcription to cell wall and
lipid synthesis as key determinants of growth rate and cell size
\citep{bremer2008, scott2010, si2017, vadia2017, harris2018, Buke2020, zhang2020}.

In this work, we consider these two questions in \textit{E. coli} by considering
both the biosynthetic capacity of key cellular processes --  meaning, the minimal
number of enzymes needed to synthesize one cell's worth of a particular biomolecule
given the observed doubling time --  as well as the physical constraints given the now
well-characterized change in cell size as a function of growth rate
\citep{taheriaraghi2015, si2017, basan2015}. As a result of an array of
high-quality proteome-wide measurements under diverse growth conditions, we have
generated a census that allows us to explore how the number of key molecular
players change as a function of growth rate. 

Here, we have assembled a singular
data set of protein copy numbers using measurements collected over the past
decade via mass spectrometry \citep{schmidt2016, peebo2015, valgepea2013} or
ribosomal profiling \citep{li2014} of the composition of the \textit{E. coli}
proteome across a gamut of growth rates. Due to notable changes in both cell
size and cellular composition as a function of growth rate \citep{bremer2008,
taheriaraghi2015}, as well as differences in normalization and standardization
schemes used in each experimental work, substantial care was taken to ensure
consistency on a per cellular basis (see the Appendix for a detailed analysis
and additional discussion). To our knowledge, this compiled and curated dataset
represents the most comprehensive view to date of the \textit{E. coli} proteome,
covering $\approx$ 4000 proteins and 36 unique growth rates, with the observed
abundance of any given protein being directly comparable between data sets and
across growth rates. This allows us to interrogate the \textit{E. coli} specific
physiology underlying the observed abundances while minimizing the effects of
experimental noise as $\approx$ 75\% of the  proteins are observed in at least
two separate datasets.

By compiling molecular turnover rate measurements for many of the
fundamental processes associated with bacterial growth, we make quantitative
order-of-magnitude estimates of key cellular processes in nutrient transport,
cell envelope biogenesis, energy generation, and the central dogma (schematized
in Figure \ref{fig:categories}) to determine whether our current understanding of the
kinetics of these processes are sufficient to explain the magnitude of the
observed protein copy numbers across conditions (see estimate rules
describing the philosophy behind this approach). The census, combined with these
estimates, provide a window into the question of whether the rates of central
processes such as energy generation or DNA synthesis vary systematically as a
function of cell growth rate by altering protein copy number, and in particular,
whether any of these processes may be limiting growth.

For the majority of the processes considered, we find that the protein copy
numbers are tuned for the task of cell doubling across a continuum of growth
rates. This suggests that most processes must be operating near their maximal
biosynthetic capacity, particularly under moderate to fast growth rates, with
cellular protein abundances increasing at faster growth rates to support the
more rapid cell doublings. This observation contrasts with the perspective
that there exists any single process that is the arbiter of growth rate.
Rather, it is through the coordinated increase in protein abundance across
these disparate processes that \textit{E. coli} is able to increase its
growth rate as nutrient conditions improve. This hypothesis is bolstered by
the observation that, when we consider the change in cell size and the
diminishing surface area to volume ratio at faster growth rates, there still
appears to be sufficient space in the cell membrane for the key proteins
required for energy production and nutrient uptake.

Given the observed importance of parallelization, where the synthesis of
additional proteins provides increased biosynthetic capacity of each cellular
process, our analysis also provides insight into the well-characterized
dependence of growth rate on ribosomal mass fraction. Here, a theoretical
inability to parallelize ribosomal protein synthesis places a firm upper bound on the
achievable growth rate that is observed at moderate to fast growth
rates, where ribosomes appear maximally utilized. Importantly, the strict
dependence between the maximal growth rate and ribosomal mass fraction coincides
with the regime where the growth laws appear most valid \citep{amir2017,
scott2010}. This enables us to suggest that the long-observed correlation
between growth rate and cell size \citep{schaechter1958, si2017} can be simply
attributed to a required increase in absolute number of ribosomes per cell under
conditions supporting extremely rapid growth. To better understand how the
observed alterations in absolute protein abundances (and in particular, changes
in ribosome copy number) influence growth rate across different nutrient
conditions, we consider a minimal model of cellular growth. Our conclusions from
these analyses provide important insight into how \textit{E. coli} regulates
growth across conditions of differing nutrient availability and identifies
fundamental constraints in bacterial growth more broadly.
