% For a half-width figure or table with text wrapping around it, use 

% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.46\textwidth}
%   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{...}
%   \caption{...}\label{...}
% \end{wrapfigure}
% \end{verbatim}
% %
% as in \FIG{halfwidth}. For tables:

% If you use the following prefixes for your \verb|\label|:
% %
% \begin{description}
% \item[Figures] \texttt{fig:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{fig:view}|
% \item[Figure Supplements] \texttt{figsupp:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{figsupp:sf1}|\\
% (we'll assume \texttt{figsupp:sf1} is a figure supplement of \texttt{fig:view} in our example)
% \item[Figure source data] \texttt{figdata:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{figdata:first}|
% \item[Videos] \texttt{video:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{video:mv1}|
% \item[Video supplements] \texttt{videosupp:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{videosupp:sv1}|
% \item[Tables] \texttt{tab:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{tab:example}|
% \item[Equations] \texttt{eq:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{eq:CLT}|
% \item[Boxes] \texttt{box:}, e.g.~\verb|\label{box:simple}|
% \end{description}
% %
% you can then use the convenience commands \verb|\FIG{view}|, \verb|\FIGSUPP[view]{sf1}|, \verb|\TABLE{example}|, \verb|\EQ{CLT}|, \verb|\BOX{simple}|, \verb|\FIGDATA[view]{first}|, \verb|\VIDEO{mv1}| and \verb|{\VIDEOSUPP}[view]{sv1}| \emph{without} the label prefixes, to generate cross-references \FIG{view}, \FIGSUPP[view]{sf1},  \TABLE{example}, \EQ{CLT}, \BOX{simple}, \FIGDATA[view]{first}, \VIDEO{mv1} and \VIDEOSUPP[view]{sv1}. Alternatively, use \verb|\autoref| with the full label, e.g.~\autoref{first:app} (although this may not work correctly for figures and tables in the appendices or boxes nor supplements at present).

% Really wide figures or tables, that take up the entire page, including the gutter space: use \verb|\begin{fullwidth}...\end{fullwidth}| as in \FIG{fullwidth}. And sometimes you may want to use feature boxes like \BOX{simple}.

% \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{.46\textwidth}
% \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{frog}
% \caption{A half-columnwidth image using wrapfigure, to be used sparingly. Note that using a wrapfigure before a sectional heading, near other floats or page boundaries is not recommended, as it may cause interesting layout issues. Use the optional argument to wrapfigure to control how many lines of text should be set half-width alongside it.}
