Abstract: >
  Recent years have seen an experimental deluge interrogating the
  relationship between bacterial growth rate, cell size, and protein content,
  quantifying the abundance of proteins across growth conditions with
  unprecedented resolution. However, we still lack a rigorous understanding
  of what sets the scale of these quantities and when protein abundances
  should (or should not) depend on growth rate. Here, we seek to
  quantitatively understand this relationship across a collection of
  *Escherichia coli* proteomic data covering â‰ˆ 4000 proteins and 36 growth
  rates. We estimate the basic requirements for steady-state growth by
  considering key processes in nutrient transport, cell envelope biogenesis,
  energy generation, and the central dogma. From these estimates, ribosome
  biogenesis emerges as a primary determinant of growth rate. We expand on
  this assessment by exploring a model of proteomic regulation as a function
  of the nutrient supply, revealing a mechanism that ties cell size and
  growth rate to ribosomal content.
