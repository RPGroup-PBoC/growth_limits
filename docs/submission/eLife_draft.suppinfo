Points in plot correspond to the the total number of PitA transporters per cell. (B) Estimate of the number of CysUWA complexes necessary to maintain a 1\% sulfur \textit {E. coli} dry mass. Points in plot correspond to average number of CysUWA transporter complexes that can be formed given the transporter stoichiometry [CysA]$_2$[CysU][CysW][Sbp/CysP].

\noindent \begin{minipage}{\linewidth } \includegraphics{main_figs/cell_wall_peptidoglycan.pdf}\par \textbf {Figure 4--Figure supplement 1.} (A) Top panel shows an estimation for the number of ACP dehydratases necessary to form functional phospholipids, which is assumed to be a rate-limiting step on lipid synthesis. The rate of ACP dehydratases was inferred from experimental measurements via a stochastic kinetic model described in \cite {ruppe2018}. Bottom panel shows the experimentally observed complex copy numbers using the stoichiometries [FabA]$_2$ and [FabZ]$_2$. (B) An estimate for the number of peptidoglycan transpeptidases needed to complete maturation of the peptidoglycan. The mass of the murein monomer was estimated by approximating each amino acid in the pentapeptide chain as having a mass of 110 Da and each sugar in the disaccharide having a mass of $\approx $ 250 Da. The \textit {in vivo} rate of transpeptidation rein \textit {E. coli} was taken from recent analysis by \cite {catherwood2020}. The bottom panel shows experimental measurements of the transpeptidase complexes in \textit {E. coli} following the stoichiometries [MrcA]$_2$, [MrcB]$_2$, [MrdA]$_1$, and [MrdB]$_1$. Grey curves in each plot show the estimated number of complexes needed to satisfy the synthesis requirements scaled by the surface area as a function of growth rate.\par \vskip 8pt \end{minipage} \vskip 16pt
