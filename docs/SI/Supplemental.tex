\section{Summary of Proteome Datasets.}

Here we briefly summarize the datasets that were considered for the work of the main
text. The goal of this section is to give an overview of each dataset
considered, including the main experimental details, and to provide a more
detailed look at how well each compares.

Table \ref{table:datasets} provides an overview of the proteomic datasets that
we found in the literature. These are predominately mass spectrometry-based,
with the exception of the work from Li {\it et al.} (2014) which used ribosomal
profiling, and the fluorescence-based counting done in Taniguchi {\it et al.}
(2010). The general strategy taken in these works is to quantify fractional
abundance of each protein and then to convert these to absolute abundance by
multiplying these fractions by the bulk measured total cellular protein
abundance. Note that the work of Peebo {\it et al.} (2014) did not perform any
measurement of cell count or volume, and thus were only able to report cellular
protein concentration.

Exceptions to this are found in Schmidt {\it et al.} and Taniguchi {\it et al.}.
A key distinction in the work of Schmidt {\it et al.} is that in addition to
determining relative abundance by mass spectrometry, they also selected 41
enzyme that cover over four orders of magnitude in cellular abundance to use in
absolute protein quantification. Specifically, synthetic peptides were generated
for each of these 41 enzymes and used to provide a calibration between measured
mass spectrometry intensities and absolute protein abundances (using stable
isotope dilution (SID) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), though the
details of this are beyond the scope of this section). In the work of Taniguchi
{\it et al.},  the authored tagged each protein with a  yellow fluorescent
protein (YFP) and used fluorescence as readout of cellular expression.

Figure \ref{} shows the distribution in reported protein abundance for   a  subset
of  the data.

An important consideration is whether the reported abundance per cell are correlated. while
we expect some variability in expression of each protein due to growth rate, the reported
values are nonetheless expected to be correlated. Figure \ref{fig:dataset_correlations} compares each dataset to the copy numbers from Schmidt {\it et al.}, grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.

The datasets encompass a wide range of bacterial growth conditions and
different {\it e. coli} strains. In order to determine protein abundance on a
cell basis,  different strategies  were taken to determine cell counts and cell
volume. It was therefore important to consider if any obvious discrepancies
exist across the data and whether these might be reasonably dealt with to make
the compiled data set internally consistent. {\it a priori}, there are
well-documented observations about how characteristics such as total protein
mass per cell and cell volume  should scale with growth rate. We were therefore
inclined to only renormalize data in a  way  that was consistent with
expectations.
In this section we describe the data manipulations that were applied to those originally reported.

% performed within the data of individual authors and not performed globally. We
% felt this was important in order not to bias any individuals' work since we lack

Figure \ref{}(A) compares the total protein mass reported as a function of

\subsection{Adjustments to Schmidt {\it et al.} dataset}

% NB: It may be useful to note that none of this should have any effect on the relative
% abundances found in each dataset.

While the dataset from Schmidt {\it et al.} remains a heroic effort and has
provided our lab with a resource that we continue to return to,
there were several steps taken in their final calculation of protein copies per cell
that needed to be reconsidered. In particular, the authors made an assumption of
constant cellular protein concentration across all growth conditions and also
 used cell volume measurements that appear inconsistent with the expected
exponential scaling of cell size with growth rate that has been well documented in
{\it E. coli} \cite{Schaechter1958, TaheriAraghi2015, Si2017}. This resulted in
a similar non-exponential scaling of total cellular protein that is unexpected and
in disagreement with other data \cite{Basan2015}.


We first consider the cell volume measurements that were used in their data
adjustment, shown in blue in Figure \ref{fig:cell_size_literature}. Figure [] we
show the cell volumes reported from [, along with cell volumes reported in three
other recent papers  (part (A) shows the data with a linear y-axis, while part
(B) shows it on a log scaled y-axis). The measurements from Taheri-Araghi {\it
et al.} and Si {\it et al.} from from the lab of Suckjoon Jun, while those from
Basan {\it et al.} come  from the lab of Terence Hwa.  Each of these additional
measurements used microscopy and cell segmentation to determine the long and
short axes, and then cell size was determined by treating the cell is a cylinder
with two hemispherical ends. While there is a large discrepancy in cell size
between the two research groups, Basan {\it et al.} shows in their  supplemental
material that this is specifically from uncertainty in determining the cell
width, which  is prone to error given the small cell size and optical resolution
limits. Perhaps the more concerning point  is that while these alternative
measurements show the expected exponential increase in  cell size as growth rate
increases, the measurements used by Schmidt {\it et al.} appear to cause the
total cellular protein  to plateau toward some maximum value.

in order to deal with
potential loss during protein extraction, the authors first determined total
protein independently with a BCA protein assay. With their flow cytometry cell
counts, and a measurement of cell volume from earlier work of theirs, they
calculated a cellular protein  concentration. In personal communications, it was
noted that  determining reasonable total protein abundances by BCA across cells
under the array of growth conditions  was particularly troublesome. Instead, they
made the assumption that cellular protein concentration remains constant  across
growth conditions. Using their previous cell volume measurements, which do vary
with growth rate, they calculated the expected  total protein mass at each
growth condition and rescaled their absolute protein measurements to be
consistent  with these values.

In Figure [] we perform the total protein mass correction that Schmidt {\it et
al.} used, but instead  using the cell volume measurements from Si {\it et al.}.
Following this adjustment, the total protein mass exibits an exponential
increase in protein mass appears to be more consistent  with expectations that
the cell size should increease exponentially with growth rate.

As a quick estimate of protein concentration, if we assume a cellular mass
density of 1.1 g/ml, 30\% dry mass, and 55 \% of the dry mass taken up by
protein, the expected cellular protein concentration is given by 1.1 g/ml
x 30 \% x 60 \%, which gives us about 200 fg / fL total protein.

We now turn to the assumption that cellular protein concentration is relatively
independent of growth rate. One important experimental result that suggests some
caution here is that the total RNA to protein ratio increases linearly as
function of growth rate []. This is due to substantial increase in rRNA as cells
grow faster. While total dry mass was indeed found to increase linearly with
cell size [], which itself suggests a constant dry mass concentration, it does
not mean protein concentration will stay constant. In order to gain some
intuition here, we will make use of experimental measurements of RNA to protein
ratio from the recent work of Dai {\it et al.}, and DNA mass from Basan {\it et
al}. These are shown in Figure []. Using this information, and the observation
that the  sum of protein, RNA, and DNA account for about 90 \% of the dry mass [],
we can predict the  concentration of each of these as a function of growth rate.
Indeed, given the  increasing rRNA, we predict a significant
decrease in cellular protein concentration at faster growth rates.

In the next three subsections we consider three different approaches to rescale
the reported protein abundances from Schmidt {\it et al.} to make them
consistent with our expectation that cell size and total protein should increase
exponentially with growth rate.  Figure [] summarizes Ultimately, we find that
each approach leads to a similar result, with absolute abundances only changing
substantially in the fastest growth conditions, in LB media and M9 minimal media
+ glycerol and amino acid supplement.



\subsubsection{Schmidt {\it et al.} copy number correction, approach #1. }

The first approach we consider is to only readjust the protein copy numbers such
that the cell volumes used in the calculation of total protein grow
exponentially with faster growth rates. Here we will allow that cellular protein
concentrations remain constant with growth rate. In order to perform this
calculation, we note that Schmidt {\it et al.} took growth in glucose as a
reference condition, and measured a total mass of $P$ = 240 fg per cell. Using
their cell volume, reported as $V_{orig}$ = 2.84 fL, we can calculate a cellular
protein concentration of $\rho_{orig}$ = $P/V_{orig}$ = 85 fg/fL. If we instead
use the cell volume predicted in the work of Si {\it et al.} which is found to
be $V_{Si_glu}$ = [], the new cellular protein concentration becomes $\rho_{Si}$
= $P/V_{Si_glu}$ = [] fg/fl. With the assumption that protein concentration
remains constant, the rescaled total protein mass per cell for all conditions
can be calculated from,

\begin{equation}
	P = \rho_{Si} \cdot V_{Si_i}
\end{equation}
where $V_{Si_i}$ refers to the new volume prediction for each condition $i$,
based on the predictions of Si {\it et al}.

\subsubsection{Schmidt {\it et al.} copy number correction, approach #2. }

In this next approach we instead rescale the total protein mass according to our
prediction of cellular protein cocentration above. Specifically, we assume a
cellular mass density of 1.1 g/ml, a 30\% dry mass that remains constant with
growth rate, and 90 \% of the dry mass consisting of protein, DNA, and RNA. The
total mass concentration of protein, DNA, and RNA will then be given by 1.1 g/ml
x 30 \% x 90 \% or about $\rho$ = 300 fg per fL. We again turn to
the cell volume predictions from Si {\it et al.} to calculate the mass per cell.
Finally, from the measured DNA mass, and RNA to protein ratio shown in Figure
[], we calculate the total protein mass per cell. These are shown in Figure [].

\subsubsection{Schmidt {\it et al.} copy number correction, approach #3. }

In our last appoach we make no assumptions about protein concentration or cell
volume. Instead we rescale the total protein according to the experimentally
measured protein per cell that was reported in the work Basan {\it et al} and is
reproduced in Figure []. While the strain of {\it E. coli} appears to differ
from the strain used by Schmidt {\it et al.}, we note that the absolute protein
abundances appear consistent with the values we estimated in the previous
section and suggest this approach is reasonable valid. To estimate the total
protein for each growth condition considered, we fit the data from Basan {\it et
al.} to an exponential function and then use this to predict total protein mass
for each of the measured growth rates. These are also plotted in Figure [].





One parameter that we do not expect to change substantially across growth
conditions is cellular protein concentration. As a general rule of thumb, we
expect an {\it e. coli} cell to have about 30\% dry mass, with about 55\% of
this expected from protein. With a density of about 1.1 g/ml, we find that the
protein concentration in a cell should be approximately 180 fg/fL.  The cellular
density and dry mass are essentially fixed, with the fraction of cellular
protein varying from [X-Y; refs??]. Hence,  this parameter provides a useful
reference point that datasets should agree on.  Indeed, out of concern over
differences in protein extraction efficiency in growth phases like stationary
phase, Schmidt {\it et al.} applied a correction to their measured protein
abundances to ensure cellular protein concentrations were internally consistent.


From the work of Schmidt {\it et al.} they reported an ability to consistently get high
protein yield from cells grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose. In order
to account any protein loss during extraction, they use their measured protein concentration
from this sample as a reference for which total protein concentration in all other growth
conditions should match. This is shown in Figure \ref{}A. One challenge in
performing this calculation is that cell volume must be known; the authors use
volumes that were  measured by flow cytometry in previous work [cite]. These
volumes are shown in Figure \ref{}B. While it is difficult to assess the
accuracy of these numbers, we find them to be quite inconsistent with the
expected scaling that is reported by Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.} (2015),
carefully
measured as a function of growth rate [and other work?].

In addition, since cell volume was not determined in all studies, and to be
consistent throughout, we instead use the predicted cell volumes from
Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.}. Dealing with each dataset seperately, we apply
correction  factors to correct for discrepencies in protein concentration across
the different growth conditions considered [NB: I wonder if in these other
datasets, the more appropriate thing to do is match to the average measured
protein concentration]. Specifically, the scaling factor $\phi$ is given by,

\begin{equation}
\phi  =  \frac{P_i}{V_i} \cdot [P]_r
\end{equation}

where $P_i$ is the total protein mass in conditino $i$, $V_i$ is the estimated cell volume, and $[P]_r$ is
the reference protein concentration (i.e. growth in  glucose for the Schmidt data).


\subsection{Peebo {\it et al.}: Conversion from copies/ fL to copies per cell}

In the work of Peebo {\it et al.}, the authors only report protein concentration.
In  order to determine protein per cell, we multiple these concentrations by
expected cell volumes  using the predictions from  Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.} This is
shown in Figure \ref{}A, where we see that reported mass is substantially lower than
the other work considered here; as well as work from others [Sinauer, 1990].

Indeed, both Schmidt {\it et al.} and Li {\it et al.} reported a total protein mass of about
250 fg per cell at a growth rate of about $\lambda \approx 0.5 hr^{-1}$ ( M9
minimal media with glucose and MOPS minimal media, respectively). Given this
discrepancy, in addition to requiring that cellular protein concentration be
internally consistent across the growth conditions they reported on, we also
required that total cellular mass be consistent with the work Schmidt {\it et al.} and
Li {\it et al.} This amounted to performing a linear regression between total protein
mass and growth rate, and using this to scale the Peebo {\it et al.} dataset according
to this trend.

\section{Translation-dependent limits on the rate of cell division.}

Here we consider the hypothesis that the process of translation sets the speed
limit of bacterial growth. We begin by considering the synthesis of the ribosome
itself, finding that it sets a strict limit on division time, and then from there we
consider how the remaining proteome further limits this achievable growth rate.

\subsection{Maximum possible growth rate is set by the time to make a ribosome.}

\marginnote{\small{NB: This time is longer if we need to add in e.g. elongation
factors as a 'core' protein to replicate a ribosome. RP to NB: rRNA estimate can
also go here.}}

Ribosomes take a unique position among proteins due to their role in
synthesizing the entire cellular proteome. In order for a cell to maintain its
own pool of ribosomes during division into two daughter cells, a primary
requirement is that the number of ribosomes must be doubled.  Since the  mass of
a single ribosome is about 2.5 MDa, with about 2/3 RNA and 1/3 protein, each
ribosome has to make about 800 kDa of protein. In {\it E. coli},
this corresponds to 7,459 amino acids. At a maximal translation rate of 20 amino
acids per second, this would take just over 6 minutes.  Growing any faster would
result in a drop in the average number of ribosomes as the cell divides and
highlights a strict time limit on how fast a cell can double itself.  This
result is irrespective of the absolute number of ribosomes, and contrasts with
other proteins where the simple solution to making more proteins is to
apparently devote more ribosomes to their synthesis.

\subsection{The translation-limited growth rate is set by the fraction of
ribosomal mass.}

While the inability to parallelize ribosomal synthesis sets an inherent speed
limit, this also represents a somewhat unachievable growth rate since ribosomes must
spend some of their time doubling the remaining proteome. A
translation-limited rate of growth is therefore set by the time to double the
entire proteome. In order to understand the consequence of each ribosome having
to duplicate itself, but also devote time to double the remaining proteome, we
consider a hypothetical cell that consists of only two species of protein:
ribosomes and non-ribosomal proteins. The cell is taken to contain $R$ ribosomes
per cell, and $P$ non-ribosomal proteins per cell. The time $\tau$ needed to
duplicate the entire proteome is simply given by,


% The only way to reach the minimum duplication time
% set by the ribosome would be to increase the relative fraction of ribosomes.
% This would effectively reduce the time needed to duplicate the non-ribosomal
% proteins.

\begin{equation}
	\tau = \tau_R + \tau_P,
\label{eq:tau}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_R$ is the time to double the ribosome copy number and $\tau_P$ is the time
required to double the non-ribosomal proteins. While we found that $\tau_R$ is fixed
at about 6 minutes,  $\tau_P$  will depend on the number of ribosomes $R$ available and
can be approximated by,

\begin{equation}
\tau_P = \frac{N_{aa}}{r_t \cdot R}.
\label{eq:tau_P}
\end{equation}
Here $N_{aa}$ refers to the total number of amino acids (aa) that must be
translated, while $r_t$ refers to the elongation rate of translation.
The translation-limited growth rate can then be calculated from,

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} =  \frac{ln(2)} {\tau}.
\end{equation}
Using Equation \ref{eq:tau_P} and \ref{eq:tau}, this becomes,
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} =  \frac{ln(2)} {\tau_R + \frac{N_{aa}}{r_t \cdot R}}.
\label{eq:lambda_max}
\end{equation}
We can see from Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max} that the only way to increase the
translation-limited growth rate would be to make more ribosomes, or if it were
possible, to decrease the number of non-ribosomal proteins. For now we will assume
that the translation elongation rate is fixed at about 20 aa/s but will return to this
assumption in a later section.

let's now use some representative values for $R$ and $N_{aa}$ to calculate
$\lambda_{\text{max}}$. From Schmidt {\it et al.}, cells grown in glucose were
found to have 214 fg of non-ribosomal  protein mass \cite{Schmidt2016}. Taking
the molecular weight of an average amino acid to be 110 g/mol and using Avogadro's number $N_A$, we can estimate
$N_{aa}$ = 214 x 10$^{-15}$g / (110 g/mol) x $N_A$,
which corresponds to about 1x10$^9$ amino acids.  Similarly, we can use their
reported ribosomal mass of about 29 fg to estimate the ribosomal copy number,
$R$. With a molecular weight of about 800 kg/mol as noted earlier,  $R$ =
29 x 10$^{-18}$kg / (800 kg/mol) x $N_A$,   which we find to be about 22,000 per
cell. Using Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max}, this corresponds to a maximum growth
rate of 0.8 hr$^{-1}$, versus the measured rate of 0.58 hr$^{-1}$, suggesting
cells are growing slightly below their maximal rate.

Since the only way to divide faster than this limit set at 0.8 hr$^{-1}$ would be
for the cell to increase the number of ribosomes, we next consider how
growth rate might vary as a function of ribosomal copy number. To
keep our problem simple,  lets first proceed with the simplifying assumption
that our cell consists of  214 fg of non-ribosomal protein, and consider
how $\lambda_{\text{max}}$ varies  as a function of the ribosome copy number $R$
using Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max}.  While in reality we might expect other
proteins to increase in proportion to the number of ribosomes, this calculation
provides us with a bound on the maximum growth rate as a function of $R$.  In
Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1} we consider the range of experimentally observed values
of $R$ from about 10,000 copies per cell to
150,000 copies per cell. One observation is that
the maximum growth rate is always less than that set by the synthesis time of a
ribosome, at about 3 hr$^{-1}$ when $R$ is 150,000 ribosomes per cell. Indeed, while not shown,
we find that $R$ would need to be increased another 10 fold, to
about one million copies per cell, to have a doubling time close to that set by the ribosome (with a 6 minute ribosome synthesis time
corresponding to a growth rate of about 7 hr $^{-1}$).

% One difficultly that
% arises is that in order for a cell to add more ribosomes, it will need to
% increase in size. This might require that other proteins also increase in number to
% maintain a specific proportion relative to the cell size. However,
% that the value of $N_{aa}$ is sufficient to
% build a cell irrespective of the number of ribosomes.
% This in effect provides us with a
% lower bound on the total proteomic content at faster growth rates and a lower
% limit on the achievable growth rate.

  \label{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1}
\end{figure}

Given how many ribosomes a cell would need in order to double a cell in 6 minutes,
it is also useful to consider what this might mean with
respect to cell size. Note that cell volume will be proportional to cell mass.
We can estimate a lower bound on the required cell volume as a function of the
$R$ by assuming a mass density of 1.1 g/ml, and a dry mass of 30\% consisting of
only protein and RNA. This is plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_volume}, where we've extended the range of $R$ up
to about one million copies per cell. While we find cell volumes consistent with our expectation for {\it E. coli}
for values of $R$ less than about 100,000 per cell, the plot also highlights that a cell would need to be
excessively largem with a minimal volume of about 25 $f$L, in order for
$\lambda_{\text{max}}$ to be close to the 6 minute doubling time set by the ribosome.

	a 30 \% dry mass, and cell mass density of 1.1 g/ml. }
  \label{fig:estimates_translation_volume}
\end{figure}

As a last consideration, one additional observation from Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_toy_1}B
is an apparently linear dependence
between $\lambda_{\text{max}}$  and the fraction of ribosomal mass. This, along with the
scaling in ribosomal copy number, are particularly relevant to the
phenomenological growth laws reported by others on how cell size and cell mass
scale with growth rate in bacteria. The linear scaling appears to be a feature
irrespective of the size of the non-ribosomal mass, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_ribo_frac}. Indeed, with a bit of algebra, we can
re-write the translation-limited growth rate defined by Equation
\ref{eq:lambda_max} as a function of ribosomal mass fraction, denoted by
$\Phi_R$, as,

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}} =  \frac{ln(2)} {L_R} \cdot r_t \cdot \Phi_R.
\label{eq:lambda_max_phi}
\end{equation}
$L_R$ refers to the number of amino acids that make a single
ribosome ($L_R$ = 7,459 aa for a complete ribosome in {\it E. coli}). As a sanity check, we can quickly
see that if $\Phi_R$ = 1, we are once again limited only by the time required to
double a ribosome $L_R / r_t$.

\subsection{Growth only appears translation-limited in rich growth media.}

With an expectation on the maximum growth rate achievable as a function of
ribosomal content from our discussion above, lets now take a look at our experimental
data. From Equation \ref{eq:lambda_max_phi}, we found that the
translation-limited growth  rate is simply determined by the fractional
ribosomal mass $\Phi_R$ which we can easily calculate from our proteomic data.   In Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}A we plot this maximal growth rate,
$\lambda_{\text{max}}$, against the measured growth rates, while in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}B we plot the cell cycle or doubling time that would be
associated with these growth rates. The shaded regions identify regions that
should not be attainable with a translation elongation rate $r_t$ of 20 aa/s.
From these two plots, it appears that cells are only translation-limited in rich
media (data points with growth rates greater than $\approx$ 1 hr$^{-1}$ in Figure
\ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}A)).

\subsection{The effect of a non-constant translation elongation rate.}

From Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_data}B it is apparent that for cells
with slower growth, the cell cycle time is indeed much longer than might have
been expected under translation-limited growth. The remaining parameter we have yet to
consider is the elongation rate $r_t$, which we have assumed to be 20 aa/s. Recent
measurements of elongation rate from Dai {\it et al.} \cite{Dai2016} across a
wide range of growth rates found that it indeed varies with growth rate. In particular,
they showed that the rate decreased to as low as 8 aa/s and exhibited a a Michaelis–Menten dependence on the
ribosomal fraction. Here we use their result to further consider the consequence of a
decreasing elongation rate $r_t$ on the maximum predicted growth rate.

% We can actually infer what
% the effective translation is given the observed growth rates, which we show
% in Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_rate}.  Interestingly, these
% translation rates are in good agreement with those measured in Dai {\it et al.}
% \cite{Dai2016}, which were also shown to decrease when grown under limited nutrient conditions.

In the work of Dai et al. the authors propose that there may be a bottleneck in
translation that arises due to lower  availability of ternary complex (TC)
that must bind the ribosome in order for translation to proceed. This complex
consists of aminoacyl-tRNA, elongation factor Tu and guanosine triphosphate.
To account for this bottleneck, they divide the elongation rate into two
coarse-grained timescales: A) binding of the ternary complex to the ribosome,
which will depend inversely on the effective TC concentration $[TC_{eff}]$, and
B) other enzymatic processes that will not depend
on TC concentration. Letting these two timescales be 1/($k_{on} \cdot
[TC_{eff}]$) and 1/$r_t$, the new elongation rate is given by,

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_t'} = \frac{1}{k_{on} \cdot [TC_{eff}]} + \frac{1}{r_t}
\label{eq:rate_dai}
\end{equation}
where $r_t/k_{on}$ is the binding constant of the TC with the ribosome. Further
taking $[TC_{eff}]$ to be proportional to the RNA/protein ratio,

\begin{equation}
[TC_{eff}] = C \cdot (R_m/P_m),
\label{eq:elong_rate}
\end{equation}
they find that  $r_t$ = 22 aa/s, $k_{on}$ = 6.4 $\mu M^{-1}s^{-1}$, and
$C$ = 31 $\mu M$.

\marginnote{\small{This assumption of proportionality
is something that will need some more consideration.}}

Using the elongation rate calculated from Equation \ref{eq:elong_rate}, we can now
recalculate the translation-limited growth rate,

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\text{max}}' =  \frac{ln(2)} {L_R} \cdot r_t' \cdot \Phi_R,
\label{eq:lambda_max_phi_dai}
\end{equation}
where we denote $\lambda_{\text{max}}'$ as the translation-limited growth rate when elongation rates is no longer assumed
to be fixed at 20 aa/s. Plugging in the translation rate $r_t'$ given by Equation \ref{eq:rate_dai}
along with the measured fraction of ribosomal mass $\Phi_R$ from each dataset, we find a
further improvement in agreement between the measured and translation-limited growth rates.
This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:estimates_translation_data_dai}. This is particularly true with
the data from Li {\it et al.} and Schmidt {\it et al.}, though we note that
for the poorest nutrient conditions (i.e. the longest cell cycle time) a
discrepancy still appears to exist.

\section{Nutrient-dependent limits on the rate of cell division.}

% Consider starting by showing the data from Dai et al. and propose alternative
% explanation.

In the preceeding section we identified limitations on the speed of cell
division that reflect inherent limits on the maximum translation elongation rate
and the necessity to double both the pool of ribosomes and the cell's remaining
proteome. We next consider the conseqences of nutrient limtations on the maximal
growth rate of the cell.

Here it is helpful to point out three notable experimental observations.  The
first is that in the limit of zero growth, the ribosomal fraction of {\it E.
coli} converges toward nonzero value (5-10 \% by mass). In the context of poorer
and poorer nutrient conditions, there must be a point in which cells have more
ribosomes than they can utilize. The next point, which is related to this,  is
that cells actually appear to reduce the fraction of ribosomes that are actively
translating when growing at a growth rate less than 0.7 hr$^{-1}$. Lastly, below this
growth rate, the cell's elongation rate also begins to decrease, with a minimum value of about 8
aa/s measured in stationary phase.

% only drops to aboutapproximately 8 aa/s. From
% Figure XB, we can see that that only way for a cell  to grow faster at an
% elongation rate of 8 aa/s is to increase its ribosomal fraction.

% The last point
% is that a single {\it E. coli} cell in limiting nutrient conditions still has
% about Z fg total protein,  as well as DNA, RNA, lipid, etc. whose quantities
% must all be doubled. Behind this last observation is a somewhat subtle but
% important point that the absolute  abundances that enable it to be a living
% organism must also be considered. This last point  provides us with an
% additional constraint on growth that becomes important in the nutrient-dependent
% limit and we consider this further in the next section.

\subsection{Nutrient limitation does not explain increasing ribosomal content.}

We begin by considering the consequence of nutrient limitation on the ribosomal elongation rate. In the
work of  Dai {\it et al.} it was suggested that perhaps there is a bottleneck in
the availability of ternary complex, referring to the assembly of
aminoacyl-tRNA,  elongation factor Tu and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that is
needed for translation.  If cells are indeed  reducing their fraction of
actively translating ribosomes, it is difficult to rationalize the possibility
that a protein like Tu might be limiting. If it were limiting, for example, a
simple solution seems to be for the cell to make  fewer of the unused ribosomes
and increase the number of Tu. In contrast, at least in the limit  of poorer
nutrient conditions, the possibility of limitations on more basic building blocks like amino
acids  and GTP seem more reasonable. Here we consider the possibility that the
synthesis rate of  amino acids, and therefore the cellular concentration of
amino acids $[aa]$ is limiting. An important finding from our analysis below is
that while we are able to account for both the change in translation rate and
the apparent fraction of ribosomes that are needed for a specific growth rate, it provides no
basis to explain why ribosomal content continues to increase as growth rate increases.

In order to consider that the amino acid synthesis rate is limiting, we can
follow a similar approach to that employed by Dai et al., which was to divide
the elongation rate into two coarse-grained timescales. Here we assume that  the
translation rate depends on A) binding of a ternary complex, which we propose
depends on a rate-limiting concentration of $[aa]$ and, 2) other enzymatic
processes that will not depend on $[aa]$. The effective elongation rate is given
by the inverse timescales associated with each step,

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_t'} = \frac{1}{k_{on} \cdot [aa]} + \frac{1}{r_t}.
\label{eq:rate_dai_2}
\end{equation}
where $r_t'$ is the measured elongation rate, $r_t$ is the maximum elongation
rate, and $r_t/k_{on}$ is the binding constant $K_d$ of the ternary complex with
the ribosome. Alternatively, we can re-write this in terms of the binding
constant,

\begin{equation}
r_t' = r_t \cdot \frac{1}{1 + K_d / [aa]}.
\label{eq:rate_aa}
\end{equation}
If we consider only consumption of amino acids by ribosomes, during steady state growth $[aa]$ will be depend on the amino
acid synthesis rate $r_{aa}$, consumption rate by ribosomes, $R \cdot r_t'$,  and the cell volume $V$,

\begin{equation}
[aa] =  \tau \cdot \frac{r_{aa} - R \cdot r_t'}{V}.
\label{eq:aa}
\end{equation}
Here $\tau$ refers to the doubling time of the cell in seconds. If we plug this into Equation \ref{eq:rate_aa}, we find that

\begin{equation}
r_t' = r_t \cdot \frac{1}{1 + K_d \cdot V / (\tau \cdot (r_{aa} - R \cdot r_t'))}.
\label{eq:rate_aa_2}
\end{equation}
This brings us to a somewhat confusing result. If ribosomes are in excess of the
available amino acids, ribosomes will deplete the supply of amino acids and
translation will grind to a halt. This apparent conundrum seems to be
similarly present if we were to instead consider that the supply of tRNA or GTP is
limiting. This may provide some rationalization for why a cell would
regulate its fraction of active ribosomes.

In order to proceed, we will take for granted that the cell actively regulates
its fraction of active ribosomes, and make an assumption that it does so to
support a net positive concentration of amino acids in the cell. Specifically, we are
interested in how the elongation rate might depend on a positive increase in the
synthesis rate of amino acids. Here we re-write Equation
\ref{eq:rate_aa_2} as,

\begin{equation}
r_t' = r_t \cdot \frac{1}{1 + K_d' / r_{aa}'},
\label{eq:rate_aa_3}
\end{equation}
where $r_{aa}'$ is the effective rate in which amino acid are being supplied to
each of the active ribosomes, and $K_d'$ is the apparent rate when $r_t'$ is
half maximal. Here $K_d' = K_d \cdot V / \tau$, while $r_{aa}' = r_{aa} - R \cdot
r_t'$.

With a maximal elongation rate of about 17 aa/s, we find that for any $K_d'$
less than 8.5 aa/s, the time to double the  cell's proteome will be limited by
$r_{aa}'$, and not the elongation rate $r_t$. Said differently, if
the total number of amino acids consumed to double the cell is $N_aa$, it
should take $\tau = N_aa/r_{aa}'$ to double the cell, which is less than the time
required if all ribosomes were constantly synthesizing proteins at their rate of $r_t'$.
Under such a scenario, the fraction of available ribosomes that are  needed would just be given
by the ratio of  $r_{aa}'/r_t'$.

In Figure \ref{fig:aa_limitation_2}(A) we consider such a scenario and consider the growth rate of cells
as the value of $r_t'$ is increased from 2 - 50 aa/(s ribosome). Here we have selected a value of
$K_d'$ less than 8.5 aa/(s ribosome), with a cell containing 7\% ribosome by mass.  Since we are considering cells growing in steady
state, and we assume  that the cell has some mechanism in place to match a
specific supply of amino acids defined by  $r_{aa}'$,  the fraction of available
ribosomes needed to double the cell will be given by $r_{aa}'/r_t' $, up to a maximum value of 1.
This is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:aa_limitation_2}(B).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../../code/figures/SI/aa_limitation_2.pdf}

  \label{fig:aa_limitation_2}
\end{figure}

Importantly, while this provides some perspective on why elongation might decrease in the nutrient limit,
and can be consistent with apparent regulation of the active pool of ribosomes. However, as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:aa_limitation_2}(C) it does so
without requiring any increase in ribosomal
content as a function of growth rate. This suggests that something else must be considered in order to
explain the observedtrend in ribosomal present that is still observed in the nutrient-limit.


% This provides an interesting rationalization of why a cell
% might actively regulate its fraction of active ribosomes. Specifically, while
% amino acid synthesis rate is below its consumption rate, the excess ribosomes
% would otherwise consume the available pool of amino acids and bring elongation
% to a halt. It would also be impossible to distribute the supply of 20 distinct
% amino acids as protein synthesis proceeds.

\subsection{Nutrient limitations provide another boundary on the rate of
bacterial growth.}

As an {\it E. coli} cell encounters more nutrient rich conditions, the data in
Figure XA shows that the measured steady state growth rates follows a
well-defined path as a function of ribosomal content. This reflects the
so-called growth law that has been observed for {\it E. coli} and some other
bacterium. However, we might have naively expected alternative paths to reach
the translation-limited growth  boundary  to be equally plausable. In order to
make progress it useful to highlight that experimentally, from work by Dai {\it
et al} and others, the elongation rate is expected to increase gradually
from about 8 aa/s to a maximum in rich media of about 17 aa/s.

To understand the consequence of this, we consider the hypothetical situation
illustrated in Figure Z. Here a cell is initially growing at a rate of about X
hr$^{-1}$, with an  elongation rate of X aa/s. As nutrient conditions improve
and the apparent elongation rate  increases, the maximum growth rate becomes
defined by this new elongation rate. The first  naieve scenario is that the
bacterium keeps its proteome unchanged, including the  number of available
ribosomes. Such a situation would correspond to a cell whose size  and total
contents can remain unchanged and it can just double itself faster. The  second
scenario is that the cell takes advantage of its apparent increase in protein
synthesizing  capacity, and somehow bias its protein production to make more
ribosomes. By doing so, the cell is able to grow faster given its new elongation
rate.

We next attempt to estimate the additional ribosomes than might be made from
this additional capacity. This can be determined from the relative increase in
elongation rate and the number of available ribosomes. The additional amino
acids available to put toward making more proteins is given by,

\begin{equation}
	N_{aa}' = (r_{t 16} - r_{t 14}) \cdot \tau \cdot R,
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the doubling time of the cell. The maximum additional ribosomes
than can then be made is simply given by,

\begin{equation}
 R' = N_{aa}' / L_R,
\end{equation}
where again, $L_R$ refers to the total number of amino acids that make a
ribosome. This scenario results in a cell with larger ribosomal fraction given by,

\begin{equation}
 \Phi' = \frac{R + R'}{ R + R' + P' }.
\end{equation}
The maximal growth rate at this elongation rate will then be equal to
\begin{equation}
 \lambda = \frac{ln(2)}{ L_R} \cdot r_{t 16} \cdot \Phi'.
\end{equation}
While this treatment is somewhat artificial and assumes that the cell continues
to  double its core proteome, as measured in the slow-growth limit, it provides
us with a convenient way to rationalize the constantly increasing ribosomal
fraction for growth rates below the traslation-limited growth rate. Indeed,
since cells do indeed making more ribosomes and get more massive with growth
rate, this perspective provides an a potential way to connect to the
well-characterized cell size scaling observed in {\it E. coli}.

We can repeat the same thought process for the entire range of measured
elongation rates, from about 8 aa/s to 17 aa/s, which is plotted in Figure Z.
Here we now identify a nutrient-limited boundary. This boundary represents the
scenario where any increase in cell protein mass has been devoted to making more
ribosomes.

Here it is worth noting that this boundary isn't fundamentally as restricted as the
translation-limited boundary. For example, there are many examples from the Hwa
lab where the addition of an antibiotic like chloramphenicol shift the observed
ribsomal fraction and growth rates into this region.



\subsection{Nutrient-limited building blocks and biased ribosome production.}

Here we include our proposed dependence of translation elongation on the production rate of
amino acids. Specifically, we look at how the growth rate increases as a function of
amino acid production rate using our proposed scheme above.
