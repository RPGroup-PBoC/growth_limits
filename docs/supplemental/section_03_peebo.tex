\section{Peebo {\it et al.}: Conversion from copies/ fL to copies per cell}

In the work of Peebo {\it et al.}, the authors only report protein
concentration. In order to determine protein per cell, we multiple these
concentrations by expected cell volumes  using the predictions from
Taheri-Araghi {\it et al.} This is shown in Figure \ref{}A, where we see that
reported mass is substantially lower than the other work considered here; as
well as work from others [Sinauer, 1990].

Indeed, both Schmidt {\it et al.} and Li {\it et al.} reported a total protein
mass of about 250 fg per cell at a growth rate of about $\lambda \approx 0.5
hr^{-1}$ ( M9 minimal media with glucose and MOPS minimal media, respectively).
Given this discrepancy, in addition to requiring that cellular protein
concentration be internally consistent across the growth conditions they
reported on, we also required that total cellular mass be consistent with the
work Schmidt {\it et al.} and Li {\it et al.} This amounted to performing a
linear regression between total protein mass and growth rate, and using this to
scale the Peebo {\it et al.} dataset according to this trend.
