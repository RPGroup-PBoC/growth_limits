\section{Cell Envelope Biogenesis}
In contrast to nutrient transporters, which support the synthesis of
biomolecules throughout the cell and therefore need to scale with the cell size,
here we must consider the synthesis of components that will need to scale with
the surface area of the cell. \textit{E. coli} is a rod-shaped bacterium with a
remarkably robust length-to-width aspect ratio of $\approx$ 4:1
\citep{harris2018, ojkic2019}.  Assuming this surface area is approximately the
same between the inner and outer membranes of \textit{E. coli}, and the fact
that each membrane is itself a lipid bilayer, our  rule-of-thumb of 5 \textmu
m$^2$ per surface suggests a total membrane surface area of $\approx 20 $\textmu
m$^2$ (see the Appendix Section "\nameref{sec:protein_size_SV}" for a description of the
calculation of cell surface area as a function of cell size). In this section,
we will estimate the number of key protein complexes needed to synthesize the lipids
as well as the complexes involved in assembling the peptidoglycan
scaffold that make up the cell envelope.

\subsection{Lipid Synthesis}
The dense packing of the membrane with proteins means that the cell membranes
are not composed entirely of lipid molecules, with only $\approx$ 40 \% of the
membrane area is occupied by lipids (BNID: 100078). Using a rule-of-thumb of 0.5
nm$^2$ as the surface area of the typical lipid (BNID: 106993), we can
estimate $\sim$ 2 $\times$ 10$^7$ lipids per cell, which is in close
agreement with experimental measurements (BNID: 100071, 102996).

The membranes of \textit{E. coli} are composed of a variety of different lipids,
each of which are unique in their structures and biosynthetic pathways
\citep{sohlenkamp2016}. Recently, a combination of stochastic kinetic modeling
\citep{ruppe2018} and \textit{in vitro} kinetic measurements
\citep{ranganathan2012, yu2011} have revealed remarkably slow steps in the fatty
acid synthesis pathways which may serve as the rate limiting reactions for
making new membrane phospholipids in \textit{E. coli}. One such step is the removal of hydroxyl
groups from the fatty-acid chain by ACP dehydratase that leads to the formation
of carbon-carbon double bonds. This reaction, catalyzed by proteins FabZ and
FabA \citep{yu2011}, have been estimated to have kinetic
turnover rates of $\approx$ 1 dehydration per second per enzyme
\citep{ruppe2018}. Thus, given this rate and the need to synthesize $\approx$ 2
$\times$ 10$^7$ lipids over 5000 seconds, one can estimate that a typical cell
requires $\approx$ 4000 ACP dehydratases. This is in reasonable agreement with
the experimentally observed copy numbers of FabZ and FabA
(\FIG{cell_envelope}(A)). Furthermore, we can extend this estimate to account
for the change in membrane surface area as a function of the growth rate (grey
line in \FIG{cell_envelope}(A)), which captures the observed growth rate
dependent expression of these two enzymes.

\subsection{Peptidoglycan Synthesis}
The exquisite control of bacteria over their cell shape is due primarily to a stiff, several nanometer thick meshwork of
polymerized discaccharides that makes up the cell wall termed the peptidoglycan. The formation of the peptidoglycan is an intricate
process involving many macromolecular players \citep{shi2018, morgenstein2015},
whose coordinated action maintains cell shape and integrity even in the face of
large-scale perturbations \citep{harris2018,shi2018}.
The peptidoglycan alone comprises $\approx$ 3\% of the cellular dry mass (BNID:
1019360), making it the most massive molecule in \textit{E. coli}. The
polymerized unit of the peptidoglycan is a N-acetylglucosamine and
N-acetylmuramic acid disaccharide, of which the former is functionalized with a
short pentapeptide. With a mass of $\approx$ 1000 Da, this unit, which we refer
to as a murein monomer, is polymerized to form long strands in the periplasm
which are then attached to each other via their peptide linkers. Together, these
quantities provide an estimate of $\approx$ 5 $\times$ 10$^6$ murein monomers
per cell.

The crosslinking of the pentapeptides between adjacent glycan strands is
responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of the cell wall and, in
principle, each murein monomer can be involved in such a crosslink. In some
microbes, such as in gram-positive bacterium \textit{Staphylococcus aureus}, the
extent of crosslinking can be large with $>$ 90\% of pentapeptides forming a
connection between glycan strands. In \textit{E. coli}, however, a much smaller
proportion ($\approx$ 20\%) of the peptides are crosslinked, resulting in a
weaker and more porous cell wall \citep{vollmer2008a, rogers1980}. The formation
of these crosslinks occurs primarily during the polymerization of the murein
monomers and is facilitated by a family of enzymes called transpeptidases. The
four primary transpeptidases of \textit{E. coli} have only recently been
quantitatively characterized \textit{in vivo}, via liquid chromatography mass
spectrometry, which revealed a notably slow kinetic turnover rate of $\approx 2$
crosslinking reactions formed per second per enzyme \citep{catherwood2020}.

Assembling these quantities permits us to make an estimate that on the order of
$\approx$ 100 transpeptidases per cell are needed for complete maturation of the
peptidoglycan, given a division time of $\approx$ 5000 seconds; a value that is
comparable to experimental observations [\FIG{cell_envelope}(B)]. Expanding this
estimate to account for the changing mass of the peptidoglycan as a function
of growth rate [grey line in \FIG{cell_envelope}(B)] also qualitatively captures
the observed dependence in the data, though systematic disagreements between the
different data sets makes the comparison more difficult.

\subsubsection{Limits on Cell Wall Biogenesis}
While the processes we have considered represent only a small portion of
proteins devoted to cell envelope biogenesis, we find it unlikely that they
limit cellular growth in general. The relative amount of mass required for
lipid and peptidoglycan components decrease at faster growth rates due to a
decrease in their surface area to volume (S/V) ratio \citep{ojkic2019}.
Furthermore, despite the slow catalytic rate of FabZ and FabA in lipid
synthesis, experimental data and recent computational modeling has shown that
the rate of fatty-acid synthesis can be drastically increased by increasing
the concentration of FabZ \citep{yu2011, ruppe2018}. With a proteome size of
$\approx$ 3$\times$10$^6$ proteins, a hypothetical 10-fold increase in
expression from 4000 to 40,000 ACP dehydratases would result in a paltry
$\approx$ 1\% increase in the size of the proteome. In the context of
peptidoglycan synthesis, we note that our estimate considers only the
transpeptidase enzymes that are involved lateral and longitudinal elongation
of the peptidoglycan. This neglects the presence of other transpeptidases
that are present in the periplasm and also involved in remodeling and
maturation of the peptidoglycan. It is therefore possible that if this was
setting the speed limit for cell division, the simple expression of more
transpeptidases may be sufficient to maintain the structural integrity of the
cell wall.
