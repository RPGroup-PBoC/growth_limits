The actively translating ribosomal fraction is calculated using the estimated values of $f_a$ from \cite {dai2016} (shown in inset; see Appendix \nameref {sec:SI_f_a} for additional detail). Additional measurements in addition to the proteomic measurements are based on measurements of cellular RNA to protein ratio, with $\Phi _R \approx $ the cellular RNA to protein ratio divided by 2.1 \citep {dai2016}. (B) Experimental measurements of the cell doubling time $\tau $ and cell cycle time $t_{cyc}$ from Si \textit {et al.} (2017). Dashed line shows fit to the data, which were used to estimate $\langle $\# ori$\rangle $. $t_{cyc}$ was assumed to vary in proportion to $\tau $ for doubling times greater than 40 minutes, and reach a minimum value of 73 minutes. See Appendix \nameref {sec:SI_ori} for additional details exact estimation of rRNA copy number. Red data points correspond to measurements in strain MG1655, while light green points are for strain NCM3722. Schematic shows the expected increase in replication forks (or number of ori regions) as \textit {E. coli} cells grow faster. \par \vskip 8pt \end{minipage} \vskip 16pt
