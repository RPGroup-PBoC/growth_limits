[NB: in progress. I think one useful figure for me to make is a schematic showing how absolute copy numnbers were determined in each paper we considered.]

% Here we briefly summarize the datasets that were considered for the work of the main
% text. The goal of this section is to give an overview of each dataset
% considered, including the main experimental details, and to provide a more
% detailed look at how well each compares.
%
% Table \ref{table:datasets} provides an overview of the proteomic datasets that
% we found in the literature. These are predominately mass spectrometry-based,
% with the exception of the work from Li \textit{et al.} (2014) which used ribosomal
% profiling, and the fluorescence-based counting done in Taniguchi \textit{et al.}
% (2010). The general strategy taken in these works is to quantify fractional
% abundance of each protein and then to convert these to absolute abundance by
% multiplying these fractions by the bulk measured total cellular protein
% abundance. Note that the work of Peebo \textit{et al.} (2014) did not perform any
% measurement of cell count or volume, and thus were only able to report cellular
% protein concentration.
%
% Exceptions to this are found in Schmidt \textit{et al.} and Taniguchi \textit{et al.}.
% A key distinction in the work of Schmidt \textit{et al.} is that in addition to
% determining relative abundance by mass spectrometry, they also selected 41
% enzyme that cover over four orders of magnitude in cellular abundance to use in
% absolute protein quantification. Specifically, synthetic peptides were generated
% for each of these 41 enzymes and used to provide a calibration between measured
% mass spectrometry intensities and absolute protein abundances (using stable
% isotope dilution (SID) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), though the
% details of this are beyond the scope of this section). In the work of Taniguchi
% \textit{et al.},  the authored tagged each protein with a  yellow fluorescent
% protein (YFP) and used fluorescence as readout of cellular expression.

% Figure \ref{} shows the distribution in reported protein abundance for   a  subset
% of  the data.
%
% An important consideration is whether the reported abundance per cell are correlated. while
% we expect some variability in expression of each protein due to growth rate, the reported
% values are nonetheless expected to be correlated. Figure \ref{fig:dataset_correlations} compares each dataset to the copy numbers from Schmidt \textit{et al.}, grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.
