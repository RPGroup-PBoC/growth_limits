\subsection{Data Analysis and Availability}
All proteomic measurements come from the experimental work of \cite{schmidt2016, peebo2015, valgepea2013} (mass spectrometry) and \cite{li2014} (ribosomal profiling).
Data curation and analysis was done programmatically in Python, and compiled data
 and analysis files are accessible
through a \href{https://github.com/RPGroup-PBoC/growth_limits}{GitHub
repository} and . an interactive figure that allows exploration of specific
protein and protein complex copy numbers.


% Here we can note that data was collected, curated, and is available on Github, and whatever minimal details we might want to include.
