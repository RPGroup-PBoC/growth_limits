\section{Processes of the Central Dogma}
Up to this point, we have considered a variety of transport and biosynthetic
processes that are critical to acquiring and generating new cell mass. While
there are of course many other metabolic processes we could consider, we now
turn our focus to some of the most central processes which \textit{must} be
undertaken irrespective of the growth conditions -- those of the central
dogma.

\subsection{DNA Replication}
Most bacteria (including \textit{E. coli}) harbor a single, circular chromosome
and can have extra-chromosomal plasmids up to $\sim$ 100 kbp in length. While
we consider the starting material dNTPs in \FIGSUPP[DNA_synthesis]{dntp} and
discussed further in the Appendix Section "\nameref{sec:SI_central_dogma}", here we focus
our quantitative thinking on the chromosome of \textit{E. coli}, which
harbors $\approx$ 5000 genes and $\approx 5\times 10^6$ base pairs.


To successfully divide and produce viable progeny, this chromosome must be
faithfully replicated and segregated into each nascent cell. Replication is
initiated at a single region of the chromosome termed the \textit{oriC} locus
where a pair of replisomes, each consisting of two DNA polymerase III,
begin their high-fidelity replication of the genome in opposite directions
\citep{fijalkowska2012}. \textit{In vitro} measurements have shown that DNA
Polymerase III copies DNA at a rate of $\approx 600$ nucleotides per second
(BNID: 104120). Therefore, to replicate a single chromosome, two replisomes
moving at their maximal rate would copy the entire genome in $\approx$ 4000
s. Thus, with a division time of 5000 seconds, there is sufficient time for a pair
of replisomes complexes to replicate the entire genome.

In rapidly growing cultures, bacteria like \textit{E. coli}
can initiate as many as 10 - 12 replication forks at a
given time \citep{bremer2008, si2017},  we expect only a few DNA polymerases
($\approx 10$) are needed. However, as shown in \FIG{DNA_synthesis}, DNA
polymerase III is nearly an order of magnitude more abundant. This discrepancy
can be understood by considering its binding constant to DNA. \textit{In vitro} characterization has quantified the $K_D$ of
DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to single-stranded and double-stranded DNA to be
50 and 200 nM, respectively \citep{ason2000}. The right-hand plot in
\FIG{DNA_synthesis} shows that the concentration of DNA polymerase III
across all data sets is within this range. Thus, its copy number appears to vary such that its
concentration is approximately equal to the dissociation constant to the DNA.
While the processes regulating the initiation of DNA replication are complex and
involve more than just the holoenzyme, these data indicate that the kinetics of
replication rather than the explicit copy number of the DNA polymerase III
holoenzyme is the more relevant feature of DNA replication to consider. In light
of this, the data in \FIG{DNA_synthesis} suggests that for bacteria like
\textit{E. coli}, DNA replication does not represent a rate-limiting step in
cell division. However, it is worth noting that for bacterium like \textit{C.
crescentus} whose chromosomal replication is initiated only once per cell cycle
\citep{jensen2001}, the time to double their chromosome indeed represents an
upper limit to their growth rate.
