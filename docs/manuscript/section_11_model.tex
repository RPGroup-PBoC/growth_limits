While this dependence between cell size and ribosomal abundance is apparent
across moderate to fast growth rates, it is worth noting that this scaling is
likely to change at slow growth rates (below $\lambda \approx
0.5\,\text{hr}^{-1}$). Here, the number of ribosomes $R$ no longer reflects the
cell's protein synthesis capacity, so far taken to be $r_t
\ R$. Instead, cells reduce the number of actively translating
ribosomes through the additional regulatory control of the small-molecule
alarmone, guanosine pentaphosphate [(p)ppGpp] \citep{dai2016} [more citations].

% This overabundance of ribosomes
% provides different challenges on the ability of the cell to maintain steady-state
% growth under limiting nutrient conditions, and in Supplemental
% Section XX we consider this slow growth regime further.

\subsection{[Header, Fill me in???]}

The translation-limited growth rate (\EQ{translation_limit_growth_rate})
highlights the necessity for a cell to increase its ribosomal fraction to
maximize its growth rate. However, it ignores the absolute constraints of a
growing cell, which in particular, require resources to support each translating
ribosomes and the space to house them. For almost every one of our estimates,
the proteomic data suggest that cells predominantly vary their protein
abundances in order to keep pace with the demands of a growing cell. In this
final section we consider a minimal model of growth rate control. We use it to
provide intuition into the additional constraints on that arise if cells did not
tune their ribosomal abundance and cell size according to the available nutrient
conditions [ref figure (A)].

% [do I talk about ppGpp and nutrient sensing? Maybe later once I show the trends]

In order for cells to maximize their rate of protein synthesis, $r_t \ R$,
ribosomes must be able to rapidly match codons with their correct amino-acyl
tRNAs. At minimum, this requires synthesis of (or import, for rich media) amino
acids that maintain the pool of amino-acyl tRNAs. We therefore consider this
maintenance as simply a balance between the the supply of amino acids by
metabolic proteins and transporters, at a rate of $r_{aa}$ in units of amino
acids per second, and consumption by ribosomes at a rate of $r_t \ R \ f_a$. The
addition factor $f_a$ refers to the fraction of actively translating ribosomes,
and allows us to account for the possibility of nonfunctional, immature
ribosomes or active sequestration of ribosomes mediated by (p)ppGpp at slow
growth \citep{dennis2004, dai2016}. To proceed we will first determine the
relationship between these parameters and the effective pool of amino acids,
denoted by $[AA]_{\text{eff}}$, and then use this to calculate the rate of
elongation $r_t$.

\subsubsection{A minimal model of nutrient-limited growth}

During steady-state
growth the amino acid concentration is constant ($d[AA]_{\text{eff}}/dt$=0) and the rates of supply
$r_{aa}$ and consumption $r_t \ R \ f_a$ are related to $[AA]_{\text{eff}}$ by,

\begin{equation}
\int_{0}^{\tau} \frac{d[AA]_{\text{eff}}}{dt} dt =  \int_{0}^{\tau} ([r_{aa}] - [r_t \ R \ f_a]) dt,
\end{equation}
where the time from 0 to $tau$ is a single cell doubling, and the square brackets indicate of concentration per time. Solving this, we find that

\begin{equation}
[AA]_{\text{eff}} =  ([r_{aa}] - [r_t \ R \ f_a]) \tau.
\end{equation}
Alternatively, for an average cell size of $V$,  $[r_{aa}] = r_{aa}/(V \ N_A)$
and $[r_t \ R \ f_a] = (r_t \ R \ f_a)/(V \ N_A)$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's
number. Since $\tau = ln(2)/\lambda$, which is also related to the parameters
$r_t \ R \ f_a$ and $N_{aa}$ through \EQ{mass_balance}, we
can also rewrite this as,

\begin{equation}
[AA]_{\text{eff}} = \frac{ln(2) \ N_{aa}}{V \ N_A} \left(\frac{r_{aa}}{r_t \ R \ f_a} - 1 \right) .
\label{eq:aa_final}
\end{equation}

The rate of elongation $r_t$ will depend on the availability of amino acids
(and, also amino-acyl tRNAs) in the cell. To allow us to consider the effects of
any limiting metabolic supply (i.e. insufficient $r_{aa}$), or excessive
consumption by ribosomes (i.e. high $R \ f_a$), we treat $[AA]_{\text{eff}}$ as
a potential rate-limiting step during translation. Specifically, we assume that
the rate of elongation $r_t$ depends on two course-grained timescales, 1) the
time to find and bind each correct amino-acyl tRNAs, and 2) the remaining steps
in peptide elongation that will not depend on the amino acid concentration. The
time to translate each codon is given by the inverse of the elongation rate
$r_t$, which can be written as,

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_t} = \frac{1}{k_{on} B [AA]_{\text{eff}}} + \frac{1}{r_{t}^{\text{max}}}.
\end{equation}
Here we have assumed that the rate of binding by amino-acyl tRNA $k_{on}$ will
be proportional to $[AA]_{\text{eff}}$ in limiting conditions [cite?] by some
proportionality constant $B$. The second term on the right-hand side reflects a second
assumption that elongation factors and GTP are in sufficient abundance across
growth conditions and a maximum elongation rate $r_{t}^{\text{max}}$
of about 17 aa per second \cite{dai2016}. This can be rearranged more succinctly in
terms of an effective binding constant $K_d = r_{t}^{\text{max}}/ (k_{on} \ B)$, with
the elongation rate now given by,

\begin{equation}
r_t = \frac{r_{t}^{\text{max}}}{1 + K_d/[AA]_{\text{eff}}}.
\label{eq:rt_kd_simple}
\end{equation}

By plugging in \EQ{aa_final} into \EQ{rt_kd_simple}, which also depends on $r_t$, we
can solve for $r_t$ explicitly. Its solution are the roots of a quadratic equation,
with the positive given by,

\begin{equation}
r_t = \frac{\sqrt{c^2 + 4 c \ k \ r_{t}^{\text{max}} - 2 \ c \ r_{t}^{\text{max}} + (r_{t}^{\text{max}})^2} - c - r_{t}^{\text{max}}}{2 \ (k-1)}.
\label{eq:rt_final}
\end{equation}
Here, $c = r_{aa}/(R \ f_a)$ and $k = N_A \ V \ K_d / N_{aa}$. In the final two
subsections we use this model to explore how the cell's metabolic capacity
($r_{aa}$) constrains the maximum growth rate, and then explain an apparent role
of for (p)ppGpp in mitigating translational activity at slow growth, where the
number of ribosomes is in excess.

% As a final comment, it has recently been shown that growth in a (p)ppGpp null
% strain also lacked both the condition-dependent changes in $\langle$\#
% ori$\rangle$ as well as changes in cell size across different growth condition.
% Instead, cells always exhibited a high ratio of $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$ to
% $\langle$\# ter$\rangle$, irrespective of growth rate, and a cell size that was
% more consistent with a fast growth state where (p)ppGpp levels are normally low
% \citep{fernandezcoll2020} and ribosomal fraction is high \citep{zhu2019}. There
% is also evidence that this may be achived through inhibition of DNA replication
% initiation \citep{kraemer2019}. These observations raise the possibility that
% (p)ppGpp may be playing a causal role in tuning $\langle$\# ori$\rangle$ and
% cell size, which ultimately allows the cell to vary its ribosomal content
% according to nutrient availability.
