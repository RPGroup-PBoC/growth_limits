\subsection{Data Analysis and Availability}
All proteomic measurements come from the experimental work of \cite{schmidt2016,
peebo2015, valgepea2013} (mass spectrometry) and \cite{li2014} (ribosomal
profiling). Data curation and analysis was done programmatically in Python, and
compiled data and analysis files are accessible through a
\href{https://github.com/rpgroup-pboc/growth_limits}[GitHub repository]
(DOI:XXX) associated with this paper as well as on the associated
\href{https://rpgroup.caltech.edu/growth_limits}{paper website}. An interactive
figure that allows exploration of specific protein and protein complex copy
numbers is available at [link].


% Here we can note that data was collected, curated, and is available on Github, and whatever minimal details we might want to include.
