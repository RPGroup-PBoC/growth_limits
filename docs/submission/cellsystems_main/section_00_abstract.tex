Recent years have seen an experimental deluge interrogating the relationship
between bacterial growth rate, cell size, and protein content. However, we still
lack a rigorous understanding of what sets the scale of these quantities and
when protein abundances should depend on growth rate. Here, we
seek to quantitatively understand this relationship across a collection of
\textit{Escherichia coli} proteomic data covering $\approx$ 4000 proteins and 36
growth rates. We estimate the basic requirements and physical constraints on
steady-state growth by considering key processes in cellular growth. In contrast to
perspectives that specific processes limit growth rate or dictate cell size, our
analysis suggests that cells are predominantly tuned for the task of cell doubling
across a continuum of growth rates. Importantly, a theoretical inability to
parallelize ribosomal synthesis places a firm limit on the achievable growth rates
and required proteomic composition that is reflected under moderate to fast growth rates.
We expand on this assessment by quantitatively considering a model of proteomic
control as a function of nutrient supply, revealing a mechanism that ties cell size
and growth rate to proteomic content.
