\section{Processes of the Central Dogma}
Up to this point, we have considered a variety of transport and biosynthetic
processes that are critical to acquiring and generating new cell mass. We now
turn our focus to some of the most important processes which \textit{must} be
undertaken irrespective of the growth conditions -- those of the central dogma.

To successfully divide and produce viable progeny, the DNA must be faithfully
replicated and segregated into each nascent cell. In rapidly growing cultures,
bacteria like \textit{E. coli} can initiate as many as 10 - 12 replication forks
at a given time \citep{bremer2008, si2017}, suggesting  only $\approx 10$ are
needed. However, as shown in \FIG{central_dogma}(A), DNA polymerase III is
nearly an order of magnitude more abundant while still maintaining a predicted
growth rate dependence. This discrepancy can be understood by considering its
binding constant to DNA. \textit{In vitro} characterization has quantified the
$K_D$ of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme to single-stranded and double-stranded
DNA to be 50 and 200 nM, respectively \citep{ason2000} \FIG{central_dogma}(B)
(discussed further, along with the synthesis of dNTP building blocks in Supplemental
Section "Additional Process of the Central Dogma").

    \caption{\textbf{Processes of the central dogma.}
    (A) The minimum number of DNA polymerase holoenzyme complexes needed to
        facilitate replication of the genome. Points correspond
        to the total number of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme complexes
        ([DnaE]$_3$[DnaQ]$_3$[HolE]$_3$[DnaX]$_5$[HolB][HolA][DnaN]$_4$[HolC]$_4$[HolD]$_4$)
        per cell.
    (B) The effective concentration of DNA polymerase III
        holoenzyme (See Supplemental Section "Estimation of Cell Size and Surface Area" for calculation of cell
        size). Shaded region corresponds to the range of $K_D$ values measured by \cite{ason2000},
        from 50 and 200 nM.
    (C) The number of RNA polymerase core enzymes, with measurements corresponding
        to the average number given a subunit stoichiometry of
        [RpoA]$_2$[RpoC][RpoB].
    (D) The abundance of $\sigma^{70}$ as a function of growth rate along with the same
        prediction from (C).
    (E) Number of ribosomes required to synthesize 10$^9$ peptide bonds with an
        elongation rate of 15 peptide bonds per second.
    (F) Number of tRNA synthetases that
        will supply the required amino acid demand. The sum of all tRNA
        synthetases copy numbers are plotted
        ([ArgS], [CysS], [GlnS], [GltX], [IleS], [LeuS], [ValS], [AlaS]$_2$,
        [AsnS]$_2$, [AspS]$_2$, [TyrS]$_2$, [TrpS]$_2$, [ThrS]$_2$,
        [SerS]$_2$, [ProS]$_2$, [PheS]$_2$[PheT]$_2$, [MetG]$_2$,
        [lysS]$_2$, [HisS]$_2$, [GlyS]$_2$[GlyQ]$_2$).
        Dashed lines indicate order of magnitude estimate needed at a
        growth rate of $\approx 0.5 $ per hr (light-brown point), while the gray line
        accounts for the growth rate dependence changes in cell size and doubling time.
