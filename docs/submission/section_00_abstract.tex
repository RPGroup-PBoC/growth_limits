Recent years have seen a deluge of experiments dissecting the relationship
between bacterial growth rate, cell size, and protein content, quantifying
the abundance of proteins across growth conditions with unprecedented
resolution. However, we still lack a rigorous understanding of what sets the
scale of these quantities and when protein abundances should (or should not)
depend on growth rate. Here, we seek to quantitatively understand this
relationship across a collection of \textit{Escherichia coli} proteomic data
sets covering $\approx$ 4000 proteins and 36 growth rates. We estimate
the basic requirements for steady-state growth by considering key processes
in nutrient transport, energy generation, cell envelope biogenesis, and the
central dogma. From these estimates, ribosome biogenesis emerges as a primary
determinant of growth rate. We expand on this assessment by exploring a model of proteomic
regulation as a function of the nutrient supply, revealing a mechanism that
ties cell size and growth rate to ribosomal content.
