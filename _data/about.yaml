Abstract: >
  Recent years have seen a deluge of experiments dissecting the relationship
  between bacterial growth rate, cell size, and protein content, quantifying
  the abundance of proteins across growth conditions with unprecedented
  resolution. However, we still lack a rigorous understanding of what sets the
  scale of these quantities and when protein abundances should (or should not)
  depend on growth rate. Here, we seek to quantitatively understand this
  relationship across a collection of Escherichia coli proteomic data sets
  covering â‰ˆ 4000 proteins and 31 growth conditions. We estimate the basic
  requirements for steady-state growth by considering key processes in nutrient
  transport, energy generation, cell envelope biogenesis, and the central
  dogma, from which ribosome biogenesis emerges as a primary determinant of
  growth rate. We conclude by exploring a model of ribosomal regulation as a
  function of the nutrient supply, revealing a mechanism that ties cell size
  and growth rate to ribosomal content.
