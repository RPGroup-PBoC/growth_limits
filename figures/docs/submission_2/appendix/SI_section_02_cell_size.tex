\section{Estimation of Cell Size and Surface Area}
\label{sec:protein_size_SV} Since most of the proteomic data sets lack cell size
measurements, we chose instead to use a common estimate of size
for any analysis requiring cell size or surface area. Since each of the data
sets used either K-12 MG1655 or its derivative, BW25113 (from the lab of Barry
L. Wanner; the parent strain of the Keio collection \citep{datsenko2000,
baba2006}), below we fit the MG1655 cell size data from the supplemental material of
\cite{si2017, si2019} using non-linear least squares regression as implemented by the \texttt{optimize.curve\_fit} function from the Scipy
Python package \citep{2020scipynmeth}. Throughout
the text, we usually refer to cell size, in units of \textmu m$^3$; however,
on occasion we will mention size as a volume in units of fL.

The average size measurements from each of their experiments are shown in
\FIG{final_size_data_Si}, with  cell length and width shown in (A) and (B),
respectively. The length data was well described by the exponential function 0.5
$e^{1.09 \cdot \lambda}$ + 1.76 \textmu m, while the width data was well
described by 0.64 $e^{0.24 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m. In order to estimate cell
size we take the cell as a cylinder with two hemispherical ends \citep{si2017,
basan2015}. Specifically,  cell size  is estimated from,

\begin{equation}
V = \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot (l - 2r/3),
\label{eq:cell_size}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is half the cell width. A best fit to the data is described by 0.533
$e^{1.037 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m$^3$. Calculation of the cell surface area is
given by,

\begin{equation}
 S = \eta \cdot \pi (\frac{\eta \cdot \pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{12})^{-2/3} V^{2/3},
 \label{eq:surface_area}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the aspect ratio ($\eta$ = $l/w$) \citep{ojkic2019}.

    Cell lengths and (B) cell widths show the mean measurements reported (they
    report 140-300 images and 5,000-30,000 for each set of samples; which likely
    means about 1,000-5,000 measurements per mean value reported here since they
    considered about 6 conditions at a time). Fits were made to the  MG1655 strain
    data; length: 0.5 $e^{1.09 \cdot \lambda}$ + 1.76 \textmu m, width:  0.64
    $e^{0.24 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m. (C) Cell size was calculated as
    cylinders with two hemispherical ends (Equation \ref{eq:cell_size}). The

\section{Estimation of Total Protein Content per Cell}
\label{sec:estimate_protein_per_cell}
In order to estimate total protein per cell for a particular growth rate, we
begin by estimating the cell size from the fit shown in
\FIG{final_size_data_Si}(C) (cell size = 0.533 $e^{1.037 \cdot \lambda}$ \textmu m$^3$,
as noted in the previous section). We
then estimate the total protein content from the total dry mass of the cell.
Here we begin by noting that  for almost the entire range of growth rates
considered here, protein, DNA, and RNA were reported to account for at least 90
\% of the dry mass (\cite{basan2015}). The authors also found that the total dry
mass concentration was roughly constant across growth conditions. Under such a
scenario, we can calculate the total dry mass concentration for protein, DNA,
and RNA, which is given by 1.1 g/ml x 30 \% x 90 \% or about $[M_P]$ = 300 fg
per fL. Multiplying this by our prediction of cell size gives the total dry mass
per cell.

However, even if dry mass concentration is relatively constant across growth
conditions, it is not obvious how protein concentration might vary due to the
substantial increase in rRNA at faster growth rates (\cite{dai2016}). The
increase in rRNA increases from the linear increase in ribosomal content with
faster growth rate (\cite{scott2010}), since it makes up about about 2/3 or the
ribosomal mass. To proceed we therefore relied on experimental measurements of
total DNA content per cell from \cite{basan2015}, and RNA to protein ratios that
were measured in Dai \textit{et al.} (and cover the entire range of growth
conditions considered here). These are reproduced in
\FIG{schmidt_adjustment_varying_conc}(A) and (B), respectively.

Assuming that the protein, DNA, and RNA account for 90 \% of the total dry mass,
the protein mass can then determined by first subtracting the experimentally
measured DNA mass,  and then using the experimental estimate of the RNA to
protein ratio. The total protein per cell is will be related to the summed RNA
and protein mass by,

\begin{equation}
	M_{P} = \frac{[M_P + M_{RNA}]}{1 + (RP_{ratio})}.
\end{equation}
$(RP_{ratio}$ refers to the RNA to protein ratio as measured by Dai \textit{et
al.}. In \FIG{schmidt_adjustment_varying_conc}(C) we plot the estimated
cellular concentrations for protein, DNA, and RNA from these calculations, and
in \FIG{schmidt_adjustment_varying_conc}(D) we plot their total expected
mass per cell. This later quantity is the growth rate-dependent total protein
mass that was used to estimate total protein abundance across all data sets (and
summarized in \FIG{total_protein_final}(B)).

  function of growth rate.} (A) Measured DNA mass per cell as a function of
  growth rate, reproduced from Basan \textit{et al.} 2015. The data was fit to
  an exponential curve (DNA mass in fg per cell is given by 0.42 $e^{2.23 \cdot
  \lambda}$ + 7.2 fg per cell, where $\lambda$ is the growth rate in hr$^{-1}$).
  (B) RNA to protein measurements as a function of growth rate. The data was fit
  to two lines (shown in black) due to the change in slope at slower growth rates \cite{neidhardt1991, dai2016}.
  For growth rates below 0.7 hr$^{-1}$, the RNA/protein ratio is
  0.18$\cdot \lambda$ + 0.093, while for growth rates faster than 0.7 hr$^{-1}$
  the RNA/protein ratio is given by 0.25$\cdot \lambda$ + 0.035. For (A) and (B)
  cells are grown under varying levels of nutrient limitation, with cells grown
  in minimal media with different carbon sources for the slowest growth
  conditions, and rich-defined media for fast growth rates. (C) Estimation of

\subsection{Estimating Volume and Number of Amino Acids from Ribosome Copy Number}
Towards the end of the main text, we examine a coarse-grained model of
nutrient-limited growth. A key point in our analysis was to consider  how
elongation rate $r_t$ and growth rate $\lambda$ vary with respect to the
experimentally observed changes in cell size, total number of peptide bonds per
cell  $N_\text{pep}$, and ribosomal content.  In order to restrict parameters
to those observed experimentally, but otherwise allow us to explore the
model, we performed a phenomenological fit of $N_\text{pep}$ and $V$ as a
function of the measured ribosomal copy number $R$. As has been described in the
preceding sections of this supplement, we estimate cell volume for each growth
condition using the size measurements from \cite{si2017,si2019}, and
$N_\text{pep}$ is approximated by taking the total protein mass and dividing
this number by the average mass of an amino acid, 110 Da (BNID: 104877).

Given the  exponential scaling of $V$ and $N_\text{pep}$ with growth rate, we
performed a linear regression of the log transform of these parameters as a
function of the log transform of the ribosome copy number. Using optimization by
minimization, we estimated the best-fit values of the intercept and slope for
each regression. \FIG{naa_v_fit} shows the result of each regression as a dashed
line.
