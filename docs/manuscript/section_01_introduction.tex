\section{Introduction}

Points to emphasize
\begin{itemize}
\item The past decade of work in proteomics has made high-througput absolute
measurement of protein abundance a reality. Recent groups have used mass
spectrometry and ribosomal profiling to quantify growth-dependent effects on
protein copy numbers across growth conditions. In this work, we assemble four
recent datasets that examine how cellular proteome is influenced by the total
growth rate.
