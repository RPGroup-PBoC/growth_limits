\section{Introduction}

The intimate relationship between the environment and cellular growth rate
has remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a
century.

Points to emphasize
\begin{itemize}
\item The past decade of work in proteomics has made high-througput absolute
measurement of protein abundance a reality. Recent groups have used mass
spectrometry and ribosomal profiling to quantify growth-dependent effects on
protein copy numbers across growth conditions. In this work, we assemble four
recent datasets that examine how cellular proteome is influenced by the total
growth rate.
