\caption{The Rules of Engagement for Order-Of-Magnitude Estimates}
This work relies heavily on "back-of-the-envelope" estimates to
understand the growth-rate dependent abundances of molecular
complexes. This moniker arises from the limitation that any estimate should be
able to fit on the back of a postage envelope. Therefore, we must draw a set of
rules governing our precision and sources of key values.

\textbf{\itshape The rule of "one, few, and ten".} The philosophy behind
order-of-magnitude estimates is to provide a estimate of the appropriate scale,
not a prediction with infinite accuracy. As such, we define three different
scales of precision in making estimates. The scale of "one" is reserved for
values that range between 1 and 2. For example, If a particular process has been
experimentally measured to transport 1.87 protons for a process to occur, we approximate
this process to require 2 protons per event. The scale of "few" is reserved for
values ranging between 3 and 5. For example, we will often use Avogadro's number
to compute the number of molecules in a cell given a concentration and a volume.
Rather than using Avogadro's number as $6.02214 \times 10^{23}$, we will
approximate it as $5 \times 10^{23}$. Finally, the scale of "ten" is reserved
for values which we know within an order of magnitude. If a particular protein
complex is present at 883 copies per cell, we say that it is present in
approximately $10^3$ copies per cell. These different scales will be used
to arrive at simple estimates that report the expected scale of the
observed data. Therefore, the estimates  presented here should not be viewed as
hard-and-fast predictions of precise copy numbers, but as approximate lower (or upper)
bounds for the number of complexes that may be needed to satisfy some cellular requirement.

Furthermore, we use equality symbols ($=$) sparingly and frequently defer to
approximation ($\approx$) or scaling ($\sim$) symbols when reporting an
estimate. When $\approx$ is used, we are implicitly stating that
we are confident in this estimate within a factor of a few. When a scaling
symbol $\sim$ is used, we are stating that we are confident in our estimate to
within an order of magnitude.

\textbf{\itshape The BioNumbers Database as a source for values.} In making our
estimates, we often require approximate values for key cellular properties, such
as the elemental composition of the cell, the average dry mass, or approximate
rates of synthesis. We rely heavily on the BioNumbers Database \citep{milo2010}
as a repository for such information. Every value we draw from this database has
an associated BioNumbers ID number, abbreviated as BNID, and we provide this
reference in grey-boxes in each  figure.


\textbf{\itshape Uncertainty in the data sets and the accuracy of an estimate.}
The data sets presented in this work are the products of
careful experimentation with the aim to report, to the best of their ability,
the absolute copy numbers of proteins in the cell. These data, collected over
the span of a few years, come from different labs and use different internal
standards, controls, and even techniques (discussed further in Appendix \nameref{sec:SI_exp_summary}).
As a result, there is notable disagreement in the measured copy numbers for
some complexes across data sets. In assessing whether our estimates could explain the
observed scales and growth-rate dependencies, we also considered the degree of
variation between the different data sets. For example, say a particular
estimate undercuts the observed data by an order of magnitude. If all data sets
agree within a factor of a few of each other, we revisit our estimate and
consider what me may have missed. However, if the data sets themselves disagree
by an order of magnitude, we determine that our estimate is
appropriate given the variation in the data.

\section{Nutrient Transport}
We begin by considering the critical transport
processes diagrammed in \FIG{categories}(A). In order to build new cellular
mass, the molecular and elemental building blocks must be scavenged from the
environment in different forms. Carbon, for example, is acquired via the
transport of carbohydrates and sugar alcohols with some carbon sources
receiving preferential treatment in their consumption \citep{monod1947}.
Phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen, on the other hand, are harvested primarily
in the forms of inorganic salts, namely phosphate, sulfate, and ammonia
\citep{jun2018, assentoft2016, stasi2019, antonenko1997, rosenberg1977,
willsky1973}. All of these compounds have different permeabilities across the
cell membrane \citep{phillips2018} and most require some energetic investment
either via ATP hydrolysis or through the proton electrochemical gradient to
bring the material across the hydrophobic cell membrane.

The elemental composition of \textit{E. coli} has received much quantitative
attention over the past half century \citep{neidhardt1991,
taymaz-nikerel2010, heldal1985, bauer1976}, providing us with a starting
point for estimating how many atoms of each element must be scavenged from
the environment. A synthesis of these studies presents an approximate dry mass
composition of $\approx$ 45\% carbon (BioNumber ID:
100649, see \BOX{estimate_rules}), $\approx$ 15\% nitrogen (BNID: 106666),
$\approx$ 3\% phosphorus (BNID: 100653), and 1\% sulfur (BNID: 100655) with
remainder being attributable to oxygen, hydrogen, and various metals.
We use this stoichiometric breakdown to estimate the abundance and growth
rate dependence of a variety of transporters responsible for carbon uptake,
and provide more extensive investigation of the other critical elements --
phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen -- in the Appendix \nameref{sec:SI_nutr_trans}.

Using $\approx$ 0.3 pg as the typical \textit{E. coli} dry mass (BNID: 103904)
at a growth rate of $\approx$ 0.5 hr$^{-1}$ coupled with an approximation that
$\approx$ 50\% of this is carbon, we estimate that $\sim 10^{10}$ carbon atoms must be
brought into the cell in order to double all of the carbon-containing molecules
(\FIG{carbon_tport}(A, top)). Typical laboratory growth conditions provide
carbon as a single class of sugar (such as glucose, galactose, or xylose) for
which \textit{E. coli} has evolved myriad mechanisms by which they can be
transported across the cell membrane. One such mechanism of transport is via
the PTS system which is a highly modular system capable of transporting a
diverse range of sugars \citep{escalante2012}. The glucose-specific component of
this system transports $\approx$ 200 glucose molecules ($\approx$ 1200 carbon
atoms) per second per transporter (BNID: 114686). Making the assumption that this is a typical sugar
transport rate, coupled with the need to transport $\sim 10^{10}$ carbon atoms,
we then expect on the order of $\approx$ 1000 transporters must be expressed in order to
bring in enough carbon atoms, diagrammed in the top panel of
\FIG{carbon_tport}(A).

As revealed in \FIG{carbon_tport}(A), experimental measurements exceed the
estimate by several fold, implying that the cell is capable of transporting
more carbon atoms than needed. While we estimate $\approx$ 1000 transporters
are needed with a 5000 s division time, we can abstract this calculation to
consider any particular growth rate given knowledge of the cell density and
volume as a function of growth rate and direct the reader to the Appendix
\nameref{sec:SI_continuum_est} for more information. This abstraction, shown as
a grey line in \FIG{carbon_tport}(A), reveals an excess of transporters even at
faster growth rates. This contrasts with our observations for uptake of
phosphorus and sulfur, which align well with our expectations across different
growth conditions (\FIGSUPP[carbon_tport]{phospho_sulfo} and discussed further
in Appendix \nameref{sec:SI_nutr_trans})

It is important to note, however, that this estimate neglects any specifics of the
regulation of the carbon transport system and the data shows how many
carbohydrate transporters are present on average. Using the diverse array of
growth conditions available in the data, we also explore how individual carbon
transport systems depend on specific carbon availability. In
\FIG{carbon_tport}(B), we show the total number of carbohydrate transporters
specific to different carbon sources. A striking observation, shown in the
top-left plot of \FIG{carbon_tport}(B), is the constancy in the expression of
the glucose-specific transport systems, an observation that stands in contrast
with other species of transporters. Additionally, we note that the total
number of glucose-specific transporters is tightly distributed at $\approx 10^4$
per cell, the approximate number of transporters needed to sustain rapid growth
of several divisions per hour. This illustrates that \textit{E. coli} maintains
a substantial number of complexes present for transporting glucose regardless of
growth condition, which is known to be the preferential carbon source
\citep{monod1947, liu2005a, aidelberg2014}.

Many metabolic operons are regulated with dual-input logic gates that are
only expressed when glucose concentrations are low (mediated by cyclic-AMP
receptor protein CRP) and the concentration of other carbon sources are
elevated \citep{gama-castro2016, zhang2014a, gama-castro2016, belliveau2018,
ireland2020}. Points colored in red in \FIG{carbon_tport}(B) (labeled by red
text-boxes) correspond to growth conditions in which the specific carbon
source (glycerol, xylose, or fructose) is present. The grey lines in
\FIG{carbon_tport}(B) show the estimated number of transporters needed at
each growth rate to satisfy the cellular carbon requirement, adjusted for the
specific carbon source. These plots show that, in the absence of the
particular carbon source, expression of the transporters is maintained on the
order of $\sim 10^2$ per cell. The low but non-zero abundances may reflect
the specific regulatory logic involved, requiring that cells are able to
transport some minimal amount of an alternative carbon source in order to
induce expression of these alternative carbon-source systems.

\subsubsection{Limits on Transporter Expression}
If acquisition of nutrients was a limiting process in cell division under the
typical growth conditions explored here, could expression simply be increased to
accommodate faster growth? A way to approach this question is to compute the
amount of space in the bacterial membrane that could be occupied by nutrient
transporters. Considering a rule-of-thumb for the surface area of \textit{E.
coli} of about 5 \textmu m$^2$ (BNID: 101792), we expect an areal density for
1000 transporters to be approximately 200 transporters/ \textmu m$^2$. For a
typical transporter occupying about 50 nm$^2$/dimer, this amounts to about only
$\approx$ 1\% of the total inner membrane area \citep{szenk2017}. Additionally,
bacterial cell membranes typically have densities of 10$^5$ proteins/\textmu
m$^2$ \citep{phillips2018}, implying that the cell could accommodate more
transporters if any one species was limiting. As we will see, processes
like cell wall synthesis and energy production also require space on the
membrane and this places additional limitations on cell size and surface area
that we will consider further in the coming sections.
