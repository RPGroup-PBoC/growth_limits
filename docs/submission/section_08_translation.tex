\subsection{Protein Synthesis}
Lastly, we consider the translation and estimate the number of ribosomes needed to
replication the proteome.
% We will begin our exploration of protein translation in the same spirit as in
% previous sections with an estimate of the number of ribosomes needed to
% replicate the proteome.
% Ribosomes are enormous
% protein/rRNA complexes that facilitate the peptide bond formation between amino
% acids in the correct sequence as defined by the coding mRNA. Before we examine
% the synthesis of the ribosome proteins and the limits that may place on the
% observed bacterial growth rates, let's consider replication of the cellular
% proteome.
While the rate at which ribosomes translates is well known to have a growth
rate dependence \cite{dai2018} and we consider this more carefully in the sections that follow, here we
% is a topic which we discuss in detail in
% the coming sections. However, for the purposes of our order-of-magnitude
% estimate, we can
make the approximation that translation occurs at a rate of
$\approx$ 15 amino acids per second per ribosome (BNID: 100233). Under this
approximation and assuming a division time of 5000 s, we can arrive at an
estimate of $\approx 10^4$ ribosomes are needed to replicate the cellular
proteome, shown in \FIG{protein_synthesis}. This point estimate
% , while
% glossing over important details such as chromosome copy number and
% growth-rate dependent translation rates,
proves to be notably accurate when
compared to the experimental observations (\FIG{protein_synthesis}(B)). 
In the
Appendix and in \FIGSUPP[protein_synthesis]{tRNA}, we consider the process of
ligating tRNAs to their corresponding amino acid. While this is a critical step
in protein synthesis whose efficiency reflects the nutritional richness of the
growth medium, the ability to parallelize this process by expressing more tRNA
ligases makes it unlikely to be a bottleneck for cell division.
